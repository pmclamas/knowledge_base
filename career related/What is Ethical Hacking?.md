Ethical Hacking involves companies hiring highly trained cybersecurity experts for the express purpose of infiltrating their computer networks, systems and web applications. The logic behind these simulated cyberattacks is that they enable organizations to preemptively uncover vulnerabilities, anticipate the antics of cybercriminals and create disaster recovery plans based on "real world" conditions.

Upon discovering a vulnerability, such as missing data encryption or cross-site scripting, these "White Hat" Hackers must document them and provide the organization with advice on remediation. A "Black Hat" Hacker, on the other hand, is an unauthorized intruder who seeks to extract information or compromise a system.

Benefits of ethical hacking:

1.  Finding vulnerabilities - determining which security measures are effective, which ones need to be updated, and which ones contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
2.  Demonstrating methods used by cybercriminals - showing executives the hacking techniques that malicious actors might use to attack their systems.
3.  Preparing for a cyberattack - anticipating cyberattacks and audit weak spots in the organization's cybersecurity infrastructure.

How does ethical hacking work?

Penetration testing is a form of ethical hacking that involves attempting to breach application systems, APIs, frontend/backend servers, operating systems, and more. Ethical Hackers perform a range of penetration tests to determine an organization's cybersecurity readiness, including internal testing, external testing and web application testing.

External tests are the most common type and involve someone outside of the organization attempting to inflitrate security systems. Misconfigured firewalls or vulnerabilities in third-party applications are commonplace vulnerabilities.

On the other hand, internal tests are designed to find weaknesses within the organization. In fact, employees represent the weakest link in cybersecurity as they are prone to social engineering.

In 2020, almost a third of security breaches incorporated social engineering techniques, 90% of which were phishing attacks. Worse still, spear phishing attacks account for 95% of breaches in enterprise networks.

While phishing generally involves indiscriminately sending mass emails or text messages containing malicious URLs that download malware onto the victim's device, spear phishing constitutes a targeted approach aimed at a specific individual.

Often, ethical hackers will help organizations put technical safeguards in place to mitigate the potential damages of social engineering, such as a data loss prevention (DLP) solution or strict policies around firewalls and web filtering. Employees also need to be trained to understand what cyber threats they might encounter and how to recognize social engineering.

The third type of penetration testing, known as web application testing, entails checking a website for potential bugs. This is a commonplace procedure in the software development lifecycle before the site goes live. Specifically, web testing checks for non-functional requirements such as availability, reliability, security, performance and more, all of which can be compromised in the event of a cyberattack.

Some techniques that ethical hackers use to probe a system include the following:

-   scanning ports to find vulnerabilities using port scanning tools such as Nmap, Nessus or Wireshark to scan a compnay's systems, identify open ports, study the vulnerabilities of each port and take remedial action. (A port is a communication endpoint that is associated with a specific process or service. Ports allow computers to differentiate between different kinds of traffic).
-   Examining patch installation processes to be sure they don't introduce new vulnerabilities through software updates.
-   Attempting to evade intrusion detection systems, honeypots and firewalls.
-   Performing network traffic analysis and sniffing using appropriate tools.
-   Social engineering to manipulate end users and obtain information about an organization's computing environment.

"Ethical hackers spend a lot more time doing research than hacking. The reason for that is we're trying to develop a way into the client's environment and that involves understading how they operate, what systems they have, whether those systems are vulnerable to attacks and what kinds of exploits we can develop."

"There's a lot that comes into play when you're trying to become an ethical hacker. You have to know how a network is designed and operated, how servers interact, how virtual machines, storage and firewalls work. The reality is you at least have to know how systems interoperate so that you can reverse engineer them to find vulnerabilities and exploit them."
