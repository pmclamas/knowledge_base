### 1: Exploring cybersecurity careers
##### **What is cybersecurity?**
Cybersecurity is an extension of what is often still referred to as Information Security. 

In 1961, researchers at MIT created the first password-protected system known as the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). For many, this is considered the birthplace of Information Security, which is the practice of protecting information and the electronic systems that process it from unauthorised access.

***A reasonable working definition of cybersecurity is the domain of research, technologies, and practices used to protect connected technology systems, data, and people from attack, unauthorised use, and/or damage.***

From securing elections, to national/international security, to individual online privacy protection, cybersecurity is the common thread responsible for ensuring that all aspects of society function without disruption.

Cybersecurity becomes a crucial input to the risk management process within an organisation. Cybersecurity practitioners are often looked to for their expertise in assessing the level of risk to specific business assets from the various threats that could target those assets. This creates responsibilities for security teams that go beyond just technological capability. Security staff must be able to understand the threat landscape and effectively communicate the characteristics of those threats to other areas of the business that don't have the same level of technical knowledge. Security staff must also be able to understand how assets fit within the overall business in order to more accurately describe the risks that threats pose to the business.

Since IT systems have become such an intrinsic part of the business model, their criticality to businesses has increased as well. A failure of a system that makes it unavailable for use can have enormous impact on a business. Because of the criticality of these systems, which in our modern age are typically interconnected in some way, cybersecurity also plays a role in ensuring the stability and availability of those systems. 
In cybersecurity, teams that focus on the day-to-day functioning of security defences are referred to as security operations teams.

**Examples of day-to-day responsibilities in cybersecurity:**
- monitoring for attacks across various systems
- responding to successful attacks that breach  system or systems
- assessing systems and people for security weaknesses (known as vulnerabilities)
- tracking, validating, and reporting on the fixing of those vulnerabilities
- working with developers on practices for developing secure software
- designing and deploying security measures (also known as controls)
- working with executive leaders to secure budgeting for security
- providing evidence of security controls for auditors
- maintaining various security systems (user accounts, firewalls, ...)

The level of government regulation and industry compliance requirements surrounding the use of IT systems has grown at a breakneck pace. Many of these regulations and compliance standards include detailed requirements for the way organisations secure their systems, respond to breaches or data exposures, and go about protecting consumer privacy.
Cybersecurity employees within an organisation play an important role in the way the company achieves, maintains, and demonstrates compliance with these various regulations and standards.
- digest and even interpret what the requirements actually mean.
- designing and implementing the various controls that will ultimately ensure the organisation's compliance with these requirements. These controls can take the form of processes, practices, policies, and technologies that are all intended to help the organisation protect its data and systems sufficiently according to the requirements.


The daily lives of individual citizens around the globe are completely intertwined with connected technology. From social media, to electronic communications, to mobile apps and even so-called smart devices, human beings on this planet have largely become inseparable from technology. Many who use these technologies are unfamiliar with practices for using them securely and not exposing themselves to attack. As a result, security researchers and professionals are looked to for their expertise.
- increasing security awareness.
- developing and implementing countermeasures or even identifying security vulnerabilities in consumer electronics and software.

**The cybersecurity culture**
- privacy and liberty
- open information sharing
- do no harm
	- Ethos of 'do no harm': formalised rules of engagement for testing systems, ensuring that while vulnerabilities would be discovered, they would not be exploited in a way that caused damage to a system or a person.

**The human element**
An often-cited idea within the security community is that the human element is most often the weakest link. No matter how strong our defences, no matter how good the technology, a single mistake made by a human being can still enable a malicious actor to complete an attack.
Experts focused on human behaviours and awareness training have become crucial elements in this type of security strategy. These experts focus on reshaping the way humans react to attempted social engineering attacks such as phishing, phone fraud, or even in-person manipulations. 

The inclusion of defending the human element against attack further broadens the idea of what cybersecurity is. It forces us to think beyond just technology and really consider inherent behavioural patterns, manipulation techniques, and disinformation countermeasures.

##### Summary
- cybersecurity is the domain of research, technologies, and practices aimed at protecting connected technology systems, data, and people from attack, unauthorised use, and/or damage.
- cybersecurity's role changes with context, but in our digital world of interconnectedness, it's about protecting our way of life.
- cybersecurity can benefit greatly from diversity of experiences and cultures, and the community continues to work to improve the lack of diversity.

### 2. The cybersecurity career landscape
**The many disciplines of cybersecurity**

**High-level disciplines in cybersecurity:**
- Security operations
- Security architecture and design
- Application, software, and product security
- Education and awareness
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- Security assessment and verification
- Governance and compliance
No universally accepted mapping exists of these roles and categories. Professionals across the cybersecurity community have made countless efforts to diagram and document the various roles. Since the technology and our approaches continue to change, so do the roles and the way we choose to categorise them.

**Security Operations**
Day-to-day systems management, monitoring, triage, and initial response to incoming attacks.
Skills tend to be wide ranging as they're ultimately responsible for maintaining security posture across all technologies within an organisation.
The responsibilities within security operations therefore are wide reaching. At the core of security operations is typically the Security Operations Center (SOC). This group (and often location) is dedicated to constant monitoring of systems for signs of security-related events. When a potential event is detected, these resources must triage it to determine whether it represents an attack and then initiate the proper response when necessary. 
However, Security Operations can extend beyond just the SOC. Often, administration of basic security controls within the organisation fall under security operations. These roles might be filled by a security help desk. Ultimately, they're responsible for day-to-day maintenance activities like user account administration and desktop security software management.
Those responsible for maintaining a particular defence technology may interact with the SOC and the help desk but bear the responsibility of actually maintaining and configuring those defences. 
When an alert event turns out to be an attack, they may need to engage the incident response team to provide a more sophisticated response to the problem.
They also need to be aware of the current threat landscape, because receiving regular information from threat intelligence resources is crucial.

For many who are looking to begin a career in cybersecurity, Security Operations is where they start. Security Operations roles often work with automated systems and repeatable tasks that lend themselves well to on-the-job learning and training. Additionally, individuals in these roles can easily leverage previous IT experience in their daily job functions. 
Finally, because of the nature of the role and the wide-ranging responsibilities over various forms of technology, security operations is a terrific way to gain exposure to a lot of technologies and concepts in cybersecurity.

**Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**
Whereas the SOC is responsible for evaluating potential incoming attacks and taking initial steps to defend against them, they will typically escalate to incident response personnel if a more coordinated and specialised level of response is needed.
Incident Response (IR) personnel are ultimately called upon to provide a coordinated and highly methodical response to security incidents.
The organisation's size, security capabilities, regulatory landscape, business model, and more can all be factors in the way an organisation defines its process for responding to security incidents.
The criteria for what constitutes an incident along with the process for responding to an incident is often documented in an incident response plan. It provides the steps for reporting potential incidents, the IR team's response process, ...
Many skills are useful for a role in Incident Response:
- experience with networking;
- software development;
- wireless communications.

In some organisations, the IR team might also be responsible for Digital Forensics, while in others, these two roles are separate.

Digital Forensics refers to investigating the facts of a security incident, often after the incident has been resolved.
Digital Forensics involves reviewing evidence found on systems to determine how an attack occurred and which data and systems it impacted. Digital Forensics personnel are also responsible for identifying, documenting, preserving, and providing expert opinion on evidence that is collected from the various systems involved in an attack.
All this means that a wide-ranging set of skills is needed:
- understanding low-level system behaviours can be crucial;
- understanding the chain of custody and other evidence-handling concepts.
- Detail oriented and able to write effective documentation on a regular basis.

While DFIR roles don't tend to be entry level, experienced professionals from outside the security community can often still be well qualified for a role in DFIR.

**Security architecture and design**
Responsible for specifying, designing, and typically implementing security controls and technologies. These roles are often held by individuals who are familiar with a wide range of security technologies, from firewalls and end-point protection to security incident and event management (SIEM) solutions.
Personnel in these roles need to be able to interact with non-security and often nontechnical roles to ensure that their designs and security architecture meet the needs of the business.
The security architect is responsible for not just defining requirements and designing a security solution, but also communicating that solution to various levels of the organisation, in order to get funding and support. This often requires bridging a gap between technical expertise and business acumen.

**Security assessment and verification**
When people think of cybersecurity, the first image in their minds is often that of a Penetration Tester (previously referred to as an Ethical Hacker). While this role does fall within assessment and verification, the discipline comprises many roles beyond just penetration testing.
Security assessment and verification includes the domain of activities that focus on confirming  the security posture of an organisation by attempting to identify and eliminate security weaknesses. This includes activities that not only seek to find vulnerabilities but also to provide tracking of known weaknesses to ensure they're properly prioritised and addressed. The scope of these activities can include networks, infrastructure components, software, OSINT, physical security.
- **Vulnerability scanning**
	- *Description:* periodic automated scanning of an organisation's environment for security weaknesses.
	- *Goals:* provide regular security verification across a wide breadth of the IT infrastructure.
- **Penetration testing**
	- *Description:* assessing the defined scope of IT systems by using attacker-style techniques usually consisting of both automated tools and hands-on technical hacking.
	- *Goals:* gain a comprehensive view of the security vulnerabilities within the target systems with deeper capability and intelligence than a vulnerability scan.
- **Red Teaming**
	- Description: attacking a defined scope of IT systems in an attempt to achieve a specific objective by using attacker-style techniques while evading detection.
	- Goals: emulate what a real attack may look like for understanding the true risk presented by vulnerabilities in the environment. 
- Purple Teaming
	- Description: similar to Red Teaming, but adding collaboration with the teams responsible for detecting and defending against an attack (Blue Team).
	- Goals: emulate what a real attack may look like to determine and redefine the ability of security controls to repel or recover from an attack.
- Social Engineering
	- Description: using deception and human psychology to attempt to convince personnel to expose sensitive data or provide access to sensitive resources. Usually done via simulated phishing and/or vishing attacks.
	- Goals: determine how personnel within an organisation respond to attempted manipulation and to build greater awareness of proper security practices.
- Physical Security
	- Description: attempting to bypass physical controls without being detected to achieve access to sensitive areas or items. Typically includes social engineering components (often in-person interactions) as well.
	- Goals: emulate attempts to gain unauthorised access to facilities in order to validate that physical controls and personnel responses can sufficiently repel such attempts.
- OSINT audits
	- Description: investigating public sources of information, looking for sensitive information about the organisation or its people.
	- Goals: evaluate whether sensitive data is being exposed in the public domain by business practices or personnel.

The activities involved in assessment and verification represent a wide range of skills. When we look at penetration testing, red teaming, and purple teaming, clearly a great deal of technical knowledge is needed.
These roles require the ability to identify indications that a vulnerability may exist and an understanding of exploitation techniques to verify and potentially exploit discovered vulnerabilities.
The target systems may be network devices, operating systems, systems software, or application software.

A crucial component for any organisation is vulnerability management: the processes and systems used to catalog, prioritise, and ensure remediation of security vulnerabilities within an organisation. 

**Application, software, and product security**
Application security commonly describes how organisation's ensure the security of software they've developed.
Software security is used as a way to describe security round any form of software used within the organisation.
Product security refers to securing any products, whether they're software or hardware based. 

Application security is well understood as applying security practices within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
Finding and fixing security flaws early in application development is cheaper and more effective than if the flaws aren't discovered until the software has hit production.

Since it was introduced in 2008, DevOps has challenged security to remain an effective part of the software delivery pipeline.
As security practitioners have sought to keep security practices integrated into the early stages of software development, the idea of DevSecOps has emerged.

Technical skills are important within the application, software, and product security:
- understanding how software and products are developed, down to a code or component level, is extremely beneficial for these roles.

**Governance and compliance**
Organisations are increasingly regulated by industry and legal requirements. Additionally, most organisations have internal policies and standards that describe required security controls, processes, and technologies.
It is the job of governance and compliance personnel to ensure that all the areas of the organisation are compliant with external regulations and internal policies.

Governance and compliance work more with the administrative side of the organisation. Interaction with legal and audit functions is common within the governance and compliance discipline. They're called upon to assess the organisation's current level of compliance, perform gap analysis, and work with internal and external auditors to demonstrate compliance in regular reviews.

**Leaders and Executives (e.g. CISO)**
Security leaders and executives typically represent the culmination of experience within one or often multiple disciplines of cybersecurity. As the roles become more senior, these leaders need to have at least a conceptual understanding of the various functions for which they will be responsible. 
The CISO role is often the pinnacle of a cybersecurity career. This role is responsible for all things related to cybersecurity across a large division or even the entire breadth of an organisation. The CISO needs to be able to apply knowledge of cybersecurity domains as well as business management to situations that they will encounter on a daily basis. The CISO also needs to understand how other business executives operate and how cybersecurity fits into each of their perspectives. 
These roles are not for everyone. Individuals who have a desire to understand and work in business management as much as security management will fit best in these higher-level leadership roles. They require a unique mix of technical capabilities and business administration knowledge.
While demanding, these roles can also be rewarding. Having ultimate ownership and accountability for the security strategy of an organisation is exciting. It is one way that a cybersecurity professional can build a legacy.

##### Characteristics of a security professional
- **Inventors and creators**
- **Obsessively inquisitive:** when presented with a problem, security professionals need to be motivated to dig in and do their own investigation. Whether it's responding to a potential security alert, assessing an application for a particular vulnerability, or trying to determine whether a company is fully compliant with the requirements of recently passed regulations, security professionals need to be deeply curious.
  The answers we seek are not always easy to find, so our curiosity needs to border on obsessive. Being willing to dive down the "rabbit hole" and investigate a situation until you find an answer is a common quality among the highly respected security professionals.
  This persistence in working through frustrations along the way ultimately yields powerful results. 
  This level of curiosity is found in individuals who are ready, willing, and able to learn new things. As technology grows at increasingly high rates, continuous learning is a must.
- **Compulsive learning:** 
Related to being obsessively inquisitive, it is also imperative that aspiring security professionals demonstrate the desire and ability to learn all the time. 
The strongest security personnel are those who feel a level of compulsion to fully understand how something works rather than simply accept that it works in a certain way.

Understanding the inner functioning of technology enables the ability to innovate and create new solutions. This need to understand drives a person to identify portions of technology that they want to improve and to obtain the knowledge for improving it. 

- **Considerations of anonymity:**
  Many choose to remain largely anonymous and operate behind handles and secrecy. Working in security - which can include defending systems from malicious individuals or doing battle with a potentially criminal element - can make a person a target.
  This personal decision must be made early in your career. If you choose to protect your anonymity, that work must begin right away. While you can begin your career embracing your privacy and anonymity, and then decide later to be more present and public, you cannot go other way. 
  However, there are reasons you may choose to be openly public in your identity right away. First, maintaining that anonymity is another level of effort and stress that you will need to continually endure. How you interact with others, what you say, what you share, which websites you use - all of this and more must be considered at every moment of every day. Your level of situational awareness always needs to be high.
  Anonymity can limit your ability to network, and networking can often be crucial in finding new jobs. You might want to build a personal brand as it opens many opportunities for you professionally.

##### Summary
- cybersecurity includes several high-level disciplines, and each comprises many roles and job functions.
- highly successful professionals can be found across all of the roles and job functions within cybersecurity.
- cybersecurity career paths encompass more than just those focused on highly technical responsibilities.
- the most successful cybersecurity professionals are inventors and creators who are obsessively inquisitive, compulsive learners, and believe in the ideology of cybersecurity culture.

### Skills in a hot market
**Architect roles -** security architect roles are  highly specialised breed of security professionals. This role requires a vast array of cybersecurity knowledge that spans multiple technologies, security disciplines, and organisational paradigms. As a result, these roles can have a base requirement of 10 years or more of previous experience. While they are some of the most highly compensated roles prior to management, they are also the scarcest in terms of open positions.
Architects are responsible for high-level security design. They need to be able to see across multiple technologies and build solutions that incorporate many defensive techniques. Architects spend a lot of time, therefore, in design work and analysing data collected from security tools. 

### Common skills for security roles
#### Common technical skills

##### Software development/Programming 
A strong working knowledge of scripting languages such as PowerShell, Bash, Perl, or Python is extremely helpful. 
In operations roles, security professionals typically use scripts to automate tasks, search through logs, or integrate multiple monitoring systems. Writing scripts can be useful for searching through large amounts of data, launching coordinated responses, and analysing breach evidence. Scripting even comes in handy in red-team roles such as penetration testing, where it can help conduct repetitive tasks and scan large data sets quickly.

Helping identify and remediate vulnerabilities in software is a common task for security teams. Understanding how the code behind the software works can help when simulating attacks against software to discover its flaws. It is also helpful in conducting static code analysis (source code review) and software composition analysis tasks. 

Experience in a software development role is also helpful for security professionals, especially those engaged in application security. Understanding how the SDLC and software delivery pipeline function can help security professionals better address security proactively.

##### Network communications and administration
Many SOC analysts and DFIR employees start their careers as network administrators. The ability to understanding things like TCP/IP concepts, packet-level communications, routing, and Domain Name System (DNS) pay off big when you are the one responsible for monitoring your network for attacks. 
Administration of firewalls and other network-based security devices definitely requires a solid understanding of network communications.
If you're working in DFIR and have research SIEM data or do forensic network analysis of a recent branch, that ability to understand and interpret network communications is crucial.

If you understand the OSI model, you are familiar with its definition of seven layers of network communications. Depending on the role you seek, you may need varying degrees of knowledge at any of those levels of the model. Developing knowledge in this area can open a lot of doors into the security world.

##### Cloud and cloud-native technology
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, etc. 
These environments introduce unique demands for security and administration.
New cloud-native technologies such as containers, serverless environments, and orchestration are growing in popularity as DevOps culture becomes more prominent.
Security professionals who understand the unique security threats that these technologies pose, as well as the tools used to administer these environments and technologies, are in high demand.
Becoming familiar with cloud environments and technologies can prepare you for numerous roles.

##### Cryptography
Given how inherent cryptography is to security controls and how highly valued exploits against cryptography can be, understanding at least the basic concepts is crucial across pretty much every security role. Deep understanding of algorithms and how they are mathematically applied is likely excessive for most roles.
Being able to understand the differences between various forms of ciphers, and their characteristics that make them suitable for a specific application and not appropriate for others, is crucial.

##### Social Engineering
Is the use of deception to manipulate people into committing an action or behaviour that helps expose a secured resource. 
Interactive tasks like phishing (social engineering via email) or vishing (social engineering via voice communications) campaigns might fall to someone in more of an operations role.

##### Industrial Control Systems (ICSs)
Are IT systems, devices, and networks that are used to control and monitor physical equipment and industrial processes. The equipment and processes can include manufacturing production lines, warehouse management systems, utilities management and distribution systems.
These systems use communications protocols and devices that are specific to ICSs; for instance, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) refers to devices and communications that are used for monitoring industrial systems. Various other devices such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), master terminal units (MTUs), and remote terminal units (RTUs), provide control of the various systems.
A particular challenge with ICS security is that many of these systems were not originally designed with the intent of connecting them to large corporate networks. Instead, their designs often assume they'll be isolated and protected from other network traffic. Adding to this challenge, many of the systems use lightweight versions of operating systems or even purpose-built firmware that isn't able to support many of the typical security features and controls that we're used to in typical IT systems.
Awareness of the need to secure these types of systems is increasing.
Developing knowledge of the unique characteristics of these systems, the specialised security considerations they require, and common practices for securing them, can open doors in terms of security jobs.

##### Radio communications
When people think of wireless communications in terms of IT, the most commonly recognised are likely Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. However, a whole variety of other specialised radio communications are leveraged in everything from smart devices to wide area networks. Even where these specialised communications pathways support a more traditional TCP/IP layer, the underlying implementations still have their own unique technology that can be exploited.
Then, being able to sufficiently protect these communications is fully dependent upon how well those risks and threats are understood. 
Defensive security professionals must be able to consider questions like:
- how and where within the stack does encryption occur, if at all?
- can traffic be interrupted or injected, and what capabilities are designed into the communications stack to account for these issues?
- is the underlying firmware of communications devices properly secure?

### Soft Skills

##### Research Skills
**Curiosity and passion**. The ability to look at a situation you want to understand and be able to deconstruct it and find answers is crucial to implementing effective security defences. 
Some of the best security professionals are those who don't just accept a situation for what it is but instead have a **desire to understand the why**. This **curiosity fuels our desire to research the situation and develop a deeper understanding of it**. Once we understand the situation, a person's creativity and innovative spirit can drive new ideas.

**It is a crucial skill to be able to start with an objective you know little about and begin looking for answers. You may not even know where to begin looking. Effective research is based in part on the ability to discover where to look and what questions to ask. Being able to answer those questions sufficiently is the end result.** 

It's important to have the drive to fully understand the things we perceive so that we can effectively respond. Once you understand the why of the current situation, you can move on to figuring out how to start solving those problems.

##### Problem-solving
Problem-solving and research may seem like the same thing, but they are really only related concepts in that one leads to the next.
Plenty of people excel at research but cannot figure out what to do with the facts once they have them. 

Problem-solving involves taking the facts that are known about the current state, identifying the desired state (objective), and then setting forth a plan for changing the current state to the desired state.

To solve a problem, I need to think about possible solutions and determine which will get me from the current state to the desired state. 
Not all problems are straightforward, especially in cybersecurity. Creativity is often needed when it comes to identifying the solutions that will bring about the desired state. The ability to analyse and come up with solutions when they may not be so obvious differentiates good problem solvers from the average person. 

##### Collaboration
Requires us to identify the people we need to work with to get things done and to work with them effectively and cooperatively.
In cybersecurity, we need to be able to work with other areas of the organisation to get things done. If a person does not work well with others (is abrasive, unwilling to share information, or unwilling to accept ideas from others), that person generally will not perform well in security-related roles.

Collaboration is all about a person's ability to cooperate and compromise with those who may have different goals and responsibilities. It is the capability to influence others while also being able to accept and apply their ideas to the current situation.

##### Empathy/Emotional Intelligence
Empathy is the ability to understand and identify with someone else's emotions, feelings, and concerns. To influence others, a person needs to couple empathy with emotional intelligence.
Emotional Intelligence is a person's ability to analyse their own emotions and express them effectively.
When collaborating with others, these skills ensure that a person is able to win support and cooperation from others by understanding the emotions of those they wish to work with, understanding their own emotions, and communicating in a way that bridges the  gap between the two.
Many security professionals fail to progress in their careers because their communications skills are lacking. Practicing empathy and emotional intelligence addresses that issue.

##### Multitasking and organisational skills
The ability to take in a wide variety of inputs, organise and prioritise them, and then work through them deliberately and with purpose is multitasking.
Unfortunately, not everyone is skilled in this regard. Some people are used to working on one task at a time, taking it from start to finish before working on the next task. For just about any cybersecurity job, this mode of operation simply does not work.

Multitasking and organisational skills require a person to be attentive to details and to be methodical in planning tasks. So, if you find that you struggle in those situations, it would be good to look for resources on time management and organisational skills to develop your own personal method for managing your tasks.

##### Writing skills
Whether you are a penetration tester, incident responder, or security architect, you need to be able to communicate your ideas, your proposals, and your findings in written form.

A penetration tester who cannot communicate the details of a vulnerability they discovered in a way that their customer can understand is not effective at all. An incident responder who cannot provide understandable details of a security incident to allow management to make an educate decision about a future strategy has failed in their role. 

When you are searching for a job, it is important to remember that your writing skills are one of the first things that will be assessed. Your resume and any cover letter you choose to include are early indicators of how well you communicate in written form.

##### Speaking and presentation skills
You can be called upon to present the results of research you have performed, details of a proposal for new security technologies, or other security concepts to a groups of people.

##### Summary
- while the industry is reporting a shortage of people to fill open cybersecurity roles, both aspiring security professionals and experienced individuals can struggle to find a job.
- varying levels of positions exist within cybersecurity, each introducing new challenges and responsibilities.
- aspiring security professionals should consider developing several technical skills. While no single pattern or set of skills is needed, many of the technical skills have wide-ranging applications across multiple security disciplines.
- soft skills are commonly overlooked by people seeking their first role in cybersecurity. Look at own skill set and work to improve the soft skills that apply across all cybersecurity roles.

### Preparing for and mastering the job search

No career journey can begin without self-examination and planning. 

The best way to prepare yourself for your first cybersecurity job is to realise that there is no best way. There is no one way. 

Deciding the correct path to take in developing your skills and positioning yourself to win that first job requires quite a bit of introspection.
Having something you are aiming for is critically important to building a career. You need to self-analyse and really figure out what motivates you, what makes you want to dig in, and what ultimately will spark your passion. You are going to need that motivation and passion to pursue this career. 

You also need to analyse your skills. You need to have a process for objectively looking at where you stand today and assessing the skills you have. 

### The entry-level challenge
Launching a new career is an extremely daunting undertaking. One of the most challenging aspects of the process is just finding that first role. You need something that will allow you to grow your skills while still contributing positively to the team. Finding a role that does not expect you to already have all the skills of a seasoned security veteran is tough. 

Regardless of your background, you have a place in the community. 

Diverse sets of experience are crucial to security, as discussed previously, so you just need to learn how to identify and justify the connection between your previous job experience and the security role that you seek. 

##### Know yourself
- why do you want to start a career in cybersecurity?
- what interests you?
- why security and not a software development or project management job?
- what is it about security that gets you excited?
It's important to spend dedicated time looking at what is important to you, what you want to accomplish, what assets you have currently to help make that happen, and what areas you need to focus on developing to improve your chances of success. 

The first step in this process is just getting to know who you are as a person and what makes you tick.

##### Identifying the authentic you
When you are trying to stand out in your job application, it is exceptionally important that you embrace the things that make you unique.

Job seekers need to be more focused on laying the foundations of a personal brand. How do you want to be seen in the industry, what do you want to be known for, or what is the story of you that you want the world to know? Everything you do in your job search can then center around that personal brand. As you start putting resumes out into the hands of recruiters, you want to make sure that they are seeing what makes you awesome and special.

"What's your weird?" - find that one story about you that makes you stand out. It should be something fun, personal, and genuine. 
Take a moment and think about you. What makes you stand out? What is the crazy, odd, or just simply different aspect of who you are that few people can claim? 
After you figure it out, your work begins. Find that unique element and embrace it. Use it to build a story about who you are that will make employers remember your name.
Be authentic to yourself and use that to propel yourself to the forefront of their minds. 
To do that, you need to make that story a part of every aspect of your professional persona. Present it consistently in every form of autobiographical information you share. Whether it is your description of yourself on LinkedIn or Twitter or in your cover letter that you send along with your resume, or even possibly in the objective statement you include in your resume itself, make sure you consistently share that story of who you are.
That repetitive presentation of your distinctive persona will ensure that recruiters and hiring managers remember not just your name but who you are as a person. Making those personal connections will be key as you move into the job search process.

**Exercise: find your authentic uniqueness**
1. Imagine you are giving a newspaper interview in which you need to provide a brief but comprehensive autobiography.
2. List 10 to 15 things you would most want people to know about you.
3. Write one paragraph, only one, no more than 200 words, describing yourself based on that list. You may not be able to fit all the points from step 2, so prioritise.
4. Read your paragraph. List three things that you wish you had more room to describe or explain.
5. Pick the one item that stands out the most. Is it unique and does it fit you?
The point of this exercise is to find that thing that is inherent to the way you view yourself and is therefore authentic. It is also the thing with a backstory that cannot be fully described in just a few words. As a result, it makes any outside reader immediately thirsty for additional information. When it comes to your social media presence, your professional introductions, and your resume, this is a priceless tool in making yourself memorable and interesting. This is what will make you stand out.

##### Finding your passion
Passion drives human beings to accomplish great things; it motivates us to work toward a goal despite the hardships we encounter along the way. 

If someone were to ask you right now what you are passionate about in security, could you immediately give them an answer?
For a lot of people, security is an exciting topic, and the idea of having a job that centers on that discipline is almost too good to be true. But, unfortunately, people who feel this way do not often explore any deeper. 
If you are going to try to prepare for a career in this widely diverse field, it is important to know where you want to focus your efforts. No human being can possibly learn all the skills and knowledge necessary to cover the entire breadth of security. As such, you will need to direct your efforts. Understanding what it is that motivates you and makes you want to work in this field will allow you to develop that focus.

Take a little time to really dig into your personal feelings around topics related to security. What gets you most excited? Is it the idea of having a puzzle to solve? Is it the exposure to new technologies? Is it the constant learning and evolving?

You can see a lot of similarities in the responses. It's a good demonstration of how the passions that bring a person into the field continue to motivate them through their career.

##### Developing your personal objective
Know who you are, how you want the world to see you, and what passions are driving your entry into the security community. You have documented the core of your personal brand and the reasons that you are seeking to build a cybersecurity career.
It is time to bring that together into a personal objective statement.

**Personal objective statement**
This statement serves as a constant guide to assist you through your journey. It is something you will be able to refer to not only during your job search but also as your career progresses. You will likely encounter tough decisions in your career or moments where you question whether you are on the right career path. Having  written personal objective will help remind you of how you got to where you are and help you make a decision that is consistent with your personal best interests.
Your objective statement is personal. You may choose to keep it private or use it as part of your personal brand. At minimum, it is important to derive your personal brand from your objective statement. Maintaining that integrity of your personal brand with who you are at your core is a key to being a credible and inspirational force in your career.

Include your objective statement, or a derivate thereof, at the top of your resume, It's that attention-grabbing sentence or two that will announce your intentions and make you stand out.

It should be personal to you - something that describes you, not as just another molecule in the grey mass of security professionals looking for a job, but rather what makes you, you. 

To build an incredibly powerful statement, leverage your authentic uniqueness and your list of passions to tell a story about you and what you want to do in your career. 

**Exercise: write your objective statement**
Writing an objective statement simply combines your passions and "your weird" into a single statement of one or two sentences at most. It is an overall summary of who you are and why you want a career in cybersecurity. 
The format of your objective statement will be something like "I am (personal brand) with a passion for (top one or two passions)."

*("I am a life-long hacker who since buying my first computer at age 12 has always had a passion for deconstructing technology to understand it and improve upon it")*

Quick process to turn your story into an objective statement:
1. what is the main idea in your personal brand? Make it as brief as possible.
2. choose the one or two top passions from your list that you want to highlight or that best fit your story.
3. lay out the statement as shown in the previous text.
4. edit the statement as needed to fit your personality.
5. ask someone you trust to read it and provide feedback. Does it make them curious to know more about you?
6. revise if you feel necessary (but remember, this is your personal statement, not the person's who provided feedback)

Your objective statement should inspire you and remind you of what is most important for you in terms of your career.

#### Own yourself
Let's look at a process for analysing your knowledge, skills, and experience, and building an inventory of those capabilities.

As an entry-level job seeker, it will be paramount for you to be able to express to a hiring manager or recruiter just how your prior job/role has equipped you with skills that make you a more attractive candidate for the role you seek. 
All of this will culminate in a ranked capabilities inventory that you will be able to use to better plan your personal development and match yourself with jobs that you are qualified for.
**Technical capabilities**
It is the area that most hiring managers are focused on, so your attention on developing your technical skill set is not misplaced.

**Exercise: list technical capabilities**
This list will ultimately become a living document, which you'll want to update on a periodic basis.
1. Create a document with four headings: Capability, Knowledge, Skill, Experience.
2. Think about your current or last job first and list all tasks you had to complete in that job under the Capabilities column. Think of as many as you can.
3. Do the same for any and all previous jobs you had.
4. For all the capabilities listed, put an X in each of the three columns next to it. You did this job; therefore, you have knowledge, skills, and experience in each.
5. Next think about any formal studies you have done - either in training or schooling. List any formal studies you've taken part in that are not already listed in the Capabilities column. 
6. Now consider which of these you have developed skills in, and which are only knowledge, and check the appropriate columns for each.
7. finally, think of any other non-school work or self-education that you have done. List any not already listed and again check the appropriate columns.

This will now serve as the foundation for the next step, which is identifying core skills, as well as later helping develop your capabilities inventory.

**Core Skills**
The next step is to connect technical capabilities with concepts that apply to cybersecurity.
Core Skills are the transferrable skills that each technical skill can be divided into. By understanding the core skills in each of the capabilities identified, we will build a justification for how your past non-security experience has better equipped you for that security role you are pursuing.

- processing multiple inputs
- translating inputs into response tasks
- prioritising and organising responses to maximise efficiency
- planning and executing critical maintenance activities
- maintaining focus on efficient delivery for the consumer

When you're approaching an entry-level job and don't have a lot of past experience in the field to draw on, being able to confidently justify these connections will prove valuable. 

1. From your technical capabilities list, take all the non-security-focused capabilities that you marked in the Experience column and put them in  a new list.
2. for each capability, reword your description, replacing any terminology that would identify the job or industry to which it applies. Remember, the goal is to generalise it enough that it can be applied universally.
3. after you have completed rewording the descriptions, break them into singular skills.
4. look through the singular skills and eliminate any duplicates
5. test out each skill to see if you can apply it to two or three careers from multiple other fields. If you cannot, try rewording the bullet further to truly capture a job-neutral description of the skill.

Confidence drives credibility. If you can deliver the message with conviction and passion, the receiver of that information is far more likely to accept it.

Finally, don't make the mistake of confusing core skills with soft skills. The two concepts are different. Core skills will ultimately apply to a specific task or capability of a potential job. Soft skills remain a little more ambiguous in that sense. They are not related to any one specific task and, instead, apply across the myriad of responsibilities for a given job role. Therefore, soft skills are the final list we need to look at before working on building a capabilities inventory.

Soft skills
Typically associated with higher-level personality traits and help augment a person's ability to complete many job-related responsibilities more effectively. Soft skills are a critical element when hiring managers are looking at potential candidates.

Soft skills are hard to self-analyse. It takes an incredible degree of self-awareness and objectivity to see where we excel and to admit where we are weak. No matter how objective we try to be, a level of personal bias always remains simply because we cannot perceive ourselves the way the outside world perceives us. Measurement of soft skills tends to be more subjective. 

Most soft skills are things that you can practice improving. At times you may simply have to be aware of weaknesses that you cannot improve upon and compensate for those in other ways.
