VM's allow you to experiment with different operating systems and programs. Virtual Machines are also used for creating and experimenting with different forms of malware. This is because nothing can travel outside a VM unless you allow it in the configuration settings. In addition, VM's allow you to take snapshots (or restore points).

Pro tip: if you have to download an unknown program or file from the internet, it is best practice to download and open the file/program in a VM first. This way, if the file/program contains a virus, the host computer won't be affected.

**Pros of using Virtual Machines**
- you can run multiple operating systems on top of your current system
- it's easy to create snapshots, and even easier to roll back
- you can assign how much resources your VM will use
- you have the ability to export an existing VM and import it to another computer.
**Cons of using Virtual Machines**
- since VM's have limited resources, performance is heavily impacted.
- Installing an OS can sometimes be problematic for inexperienced users.
- It often requires a lot of troubleshooting and learning
- Wireless USB adapters sometimes aren't recognized or doesn't work.

VPNs work by encrypting your data as soon as it leaves your computer, and then re-routing it through secure servers that could be thousands of miles away. This makes users almost entirely anonymous and renders their data almost useless.
However, a word of caution: some unscrupulous VPNs keep logs and monetize data just like an ISP sell internet history. Always choose a VPN that doesn't keep logs, and hasn't been flagged as a data-seller.
