### Information Security Analyst 
Technology is constantly improving and changing, making the position among the most fascinating jobs in the information technology world.
Ultimately, the work performed enables a company to conduct business in a safe and efficient manner.

##### What is an Information Security Analyst?
An Information Security Analyst oversees an organisation's computer networks and systems.
In the event of a system breach, an Information Security Analyst leads company efforts to counter such entry and prevent one from occurring again. These efforts can either thwart a breach or minimize the damage it causes.
The effectiveness of an Information Security Analyst depends largely on keeping up-to-date with both current and emerging security systems and cyber attack strategies.

- Learn the basics of how to create, analyse, and execute a data disaster recovery plan. The tasks involved can include transferring data to an off-site venue, restarting an entire IT system, and restoring its integrity in the aftermath of a catastrophe.
- Stay abreast of newly emerging technologies and methods in cyber security. These advances can range from state-of-the-art firewall systems, to new strategies built around incident responses. Being cognisant of these advances can enable Information Security Analysts to gain practical experience in staying one step ahead of potential cyber breaches.
- It's equally important to keep abreast of the latest developments on the other side of the equation. Malevolent attempts to penetrate computer networks and systems, such as malware implementation and Denial-of-Service attacks, are constantly taking a new appearances.

	**Skills an Information Security Analyst needs:**
	- strong analytical skills are key, as in-depth knowledge of computer networks and digital systems. This is needed for assessing the effectiveness of security measures and spotting flaws that could lead to breaches. Information Security Analysts must also have excellent troubleshooting and problem-solving skills, as they may need to fix any issues they uncover.
	- Detail-oriented individuals who can spot slight changes in a system's performance that may indicate a security breach, unauthorised software or malware.
	- Be proactive in anticipating information security risks and implementing new protection strategies before attacks occur.

##### How to become a Security Analyst
A Security Analyst is a pretty broad job description that refers to people responsible for monitoring computer infrastructure and information networks, to ensure they are protected.
A well-trained Security Analyst will probably have an advanced understanding of both hardware and software, and how data is stored and managed.

The Top 3 cybersecurity threats:
- ransomware attacks
- social engineering attacks
- theft or compromise of sensitive information from inside an organisation/company.
This means that cybersecurity analysts need to be prepared to deal with a wide variety of threats and look for security issues both internally and externally.

While Security Analysts could be thought of as the first responders of the digital world, as they are often called on to triage security incidents, the reality is that most cybersecurity analysts spend their time developing policies and procedures and reviewing best practices and providing training for company or organisations.
In an optimal world, a Security Analyst is taking proactive steps to prevent security breaches in the first place. That could mean constantly updating systems and software, or it could mean actively looking for ways to knock down firewalls or find loopholes in computer code or operating systems.

**Job Description**
- encrypt data transmissions and build & maintain firewalls to protect confidential information.
- develop plans and technologies to protect computer data and files against unintended destruction or modification through malware or other attack vectors.
- develop plans and procedures for dealing with data breaches & attacks.
- stay current on the latest attack vectors and develop solutions to protect against them.
- monitor computer software and current user status to protect networks and organisational information.
- develop and carry out regular risk assessments to ensure that security best practices are being met.

As the digital transformation across industries and sectors grows, security analysts will continue to be in high demand. Traditional cybersecurity analysts worked in niche industries related to vulnerable sectors of the economy, but now, consumer companies and everyday brands are hiring cybersecurity analysts to help protect their companies and operations.

### The most in-demand skills to learn
**Network -** understanding how networks work allows you to get a better comprehension of how to defend them, how routers work, what the firewall logs mean as well as the knowledge of intrusion, detection and prevention.

**Threats -** being able to evaluate threats and prevent or mitigate cyberattacks is a highly sought after ability.
_Threat Intelligence_ skills require a blend of creativity, analytical skills and technical expertise as you will need to create both short-term and long-term reports demonstrating recommendations needed to reduce and neutralize any prospective threat.
Most companies have tools in place to identify these threats, however, these tools are useless without the right professionals.

**Compliance -** businesses need people who are familiar with various data privacy regulations (European GDPR), companies need employees who are able to assess the risk and understand the paperwork and the security protocols are needed in order to keep personal data safe.

**Cloud -** more companies are moving to a cloud-based infrastructure and therefore the need for cloud-savvy professionals are on the rise. These experts need to be able to arrange, organise and monitor a virtualised environment such as SaaS, PaaS or IaaS so that they are able to protect data from being deleted, leaked or even stolen.

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) -** is software that is mostly used by public companies and large organisations where compliance with regulations are a strong factor in day-to-day operations.
SIEM combines the analysation of logs and event data for threat monitoring, event correlations and incident response of security events with the analysation of reporting on log data from security information management.
The main focus of SIEM platforms is on security-related incidents and events, such as failed logins and malware activities.
