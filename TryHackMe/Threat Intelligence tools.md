**Threat Intelligence** is the analysis of data and information using tools and techniques to generate meaningful patterns on how to mitigate against potential risks associated with existing or emerging threats targeting organisations, industries, sectors or governments.

**Threat Intelligence classifications**
Threat Intel is geared towards understanding the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary. With this in mind, we can break down threat intel into the following:
- ***Strategic Intel -*** high-level intel that looks into the organisation's threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.
- ***Technical Intel -*** looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defence mechanisms.
- ***Tactical Intel -*** assesses adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.
- ***Operational Intel -*** looks into an adversary's specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes, and technologies) that may be targeted.

**urlscan.io**
is a free service developed to assist in scanning and analysing websites. It is used to automate the process of browsing and crawling through websites to record activities and interactions.
When a url is submitted, the information recorded includes the domains and IP addresses contacted, resources requested from the domains, a snapshot of the webpage, technologies utilised and other metadata about the website.

**abuse.ch**
it was developed to identify and track malware and botnets through several operational platforms developed under the project.
These platforms are:
- **Malware Bazaar -** is a resource for sharing malware samples.
	This project is an all in one malware collection and analysis database. The project supports the following features:
		*- Malware samples upload -* security analysts can upload their malware samples for analysis and build the intelligence database. This can be done through the browser or an API.
		*- Malware hunting -* hunting for malware samples is possible through setting up alerts to match various elements such as tags, signatures, YARA rules.
- **FeodoTracker -** project to share intelligence on botnet Command & Control (C&C) servers associated with Dridex, Emotes (aka Heodo), Trickbot, QakBot and BazarLoader/BazarBackdoor. This is achieved by providing a database of the C&C servers that security analysts can search through and investigate any suspicious IP addresses they have come across. Additionally, they provide various IP and IOC blocklists and mitigation information to be used to prevent botnet infections.

- **SSL Blacklist -** tool developed to identify and detect malicious SSL connections. From these connections, SSL certificates used by botnet C2 servers would be identified and updated on a denylist that is provided for use. The denylist is also used to identify JA3 fingerprints that would help detect and block malware botnet C2 communications on the TCP layer.

- **URLhaus -** focuses on sharing malicious URLs used for malware distribution. As an analyst, you can search through the database for domains, URLs, hashes and filetypes that are suspected to be malicious and validate your investigations. 

- **ThreatFox -** security analysts can search for, share and export Indicators of Compromise (IOC) associated with malware. IOCs can be exported in various formats such as MISP events, Suricata IDS Ruleset, Domain Host Files, DNS Response Policy Zone, JSON files and CSV files.

**PhishTool**
Seeks to elevate the perception of phishing as a severe form of attack and provide a responsive means of email security. Through email analysis, security analysts can uncover email IOCs, prevent breaches and provide forensic reports that could be used in phishing containment and training engagements.

**Cisco Talos Intelligence**
IT and Cybersecurity companies collect massive amounts of information that could be used for Threat Analysis & Intelligence.
Cisco assembled a large team of security practitioners called Cisco Talos to provide actionable intelligence, visibility on indicators, and protection against emerging threats.
