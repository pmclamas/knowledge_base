Analyzing and improving cybersecurity posture is not a human-scale problem anymore.

AI based tools for cybersecurity have emerged to help information security teams reduce breach risk and improve their security posture efficiently and effectively.

AI and Machine Learning have become critical technologies in information security, as they are able to quickly analyze millions of events and identify many different types of threats - from malware exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to identifying risky behavior that might lead to a phishing attack or download of malicious code. These technologies learn over time, drawing from the past to identify new types of attacks now.

**Understanding AI basics**

AI refers to technologies that can understand, learn, and act based on acquired and derived information. Today, AI works in three ways:

-   Assisted Intelligence - widely available today, improves what people and organizations are already doing.
-   Augmented Intelligence - emerging today, enables people and organizations to do things they couldn't otherwise do.
-   Autonomous Intelligence - being developed for the future, features machines that act on their own. An example of this will be self-driving vehicles, when they come into widespread use.

Machine Learning, Expert Systems, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning are all examples or subsets of AI technology today.

-   Machine Learning uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (e.g. progressively improve performance) using data rather than being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning works best when aimed at a specific task rather than a wide-ranging mission.
-   Expert Systems are programs designed to solve problems within specialized domains. By mimicking the thinking of human experts, they solve problems and make decisions using fuzzy rules-based reasoning through carefully curated bodies of knowledge.
-   Neural Networks use a biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data. In a neural network, each node assigns a weight to its input representing how correct or incorrect it is relative to the operation being performed. The final output is then determined by the sum of such weights.
-   Deep Learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Today, image recognition via deep learning is often better than humans, with a variety of applications such as autonomous vehicles, scan analyses, and medical diagnoses.

**Applying AI to Cybersecurity**

With today's ever evolving cyber-attacks and proliferation of devices, machine learning and AI can be used to "keep up with the bad guys", automating threat detection and respond more efficiently than traditional software-driven approaches.

At the same time, Cybersecurity presents some unique challenges:

-   A vast attack surface
-   Thousands of devices per organization
-   Hundreds of attack vectors
-   Big shortfalls in the number of skilled security professionals
-   Masses of data that have moved beyond a human-scale problem.

Technologies exist to properly train a self-learning system to continuously and independently gather data from across your enterprise information systems. That data is then analyzed and used to perform correlation of patterns across millions to billions of signals relevant to the enterprise attack surface.

The result is new levels of intelligence feeding human teams across diverse categories of cybersecurity, including:

-   IT Asset Inventory - gaining a complete, accurate inventory of all devices, users, and applications with any access to information systems. Categorization and measurement of business criticality also play big roles in inventory.
-   Threat Exposure - hackers follow trends just like everyone else, so what's fashionable with hackers changes regularly. AI-based cybersecurity systems can provide up to date knowledge of global and industry specific threats to help make critical prioritization decisions based not only on what could be used to attack your enterprise, but based on what is likely to be used to attack your enterprise.
-   Controls Effectiveness - it is important to understand the impact of the various security tools and security processes that you have employed to maintain a strong security posture. AI can help understand where your infosec program has strengths, and where it has gaps.
-   Breach Risk Prediction - accounting for IT asset inventory, threat exposure, and controls effectiveness, AI-based systems can predict how and where you are most likely to be breached, so that you can plan for resource and tool allocation towards areas of weakness. Prescriptive insights derived from AI analysis can help you configure and enhance controls and processes to most effectively improve your organization's cyber resilience.
-   Incident response - AI powered systems can provide improved context for prioritization and response to security alerts, for fast response to incidents, and to surface root causes in order to mitigate vulnerabilities and avoid future issues.
-   Explainability - key to harnessing AI to augment human infosec teams is explainability of recommendations and analysis. This is important in getting buy-in from stakeholders across the organization, for understanding the impact of various infosec programs, and for reporting relevant information to all involved stakeholders, including end users, security operations, CISO, auditors, CIO, CEO and board of directors.

**AI use by adversaries**

AI and Machine Learning can be used by IT security professionals to enforce good cybersecurity practices and shrink the attack surface instead of constantly chasing after malicious activity. At the same time, state-sponsored attackers, criminal cyber-gangs, and ideological hackers can employ those same AI techniques to defeat defenses and avoid detection.

As AI matures and moves increasingly into the cybersecurity space, companies will need to guard against the potential downsides of this exciting new technology:

-   Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence can help guard against cyber-attacks, but hackers can foil security algorithms by targeting the data they train on and the warning flags they look for;
-   Hackers can also use AI to break through defenses and develop mutating malware that changes its structure to avoid detection;
-   Without massive volumes of data and events, AI systems will deliver inaccurate results and false positives;
-   If data manipulation goes undetected, organizations will struggle to recover the correct data that feeds its AI systems, with potentially disastrous consequences.

**Conclusion**

AI provides much needed analysis and threat identification that can be acted upon by cybersecurity professionals to reduce breach risk and improve security posture. AI can identify and prioritize risk, instantly spot any malware on a network, guide incident response, and detect intrusions before they start.
