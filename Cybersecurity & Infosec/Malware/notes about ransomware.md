**What is the biggest hurdle for organizations in the fight against ransomware?**
The biggest hurdle is good segmentation. Good segmentation allows for quicker containment and limits the blast radius, hopefully reducing the impact on the overall business. Since most ransomware begins with exploiting users; user education and good identity security are a must and thus big hurdles as well.

**What are the best practices for preventing human errors and security mistakes?**
Make time for threat modelling and incident response tabletop exercises. They are a great way to expand the education of the people impacted by the breach.
Threat modelling allows people's imagination to grow and for common threats to be shared and discussed more regularly. Tabletops are always great for walking through the process. Definitely throw in variables and rotate responsabilities or remove key people from playing to make it more realistic.

**Remote working has created concerns for cybersecurity specialists, exposing companies to many cyber threats. What major preventive measures would a company take to close those gaps?**
Push out MFA/OTP, limit VPN and RDP as much as possible, and move everything you can to the cloud to leverage the security technology that is better suited for remote work.

**AI and ML are playing an increasing role in cybersecurity. But can AI-based cybersecurity be a complete replacement for human security staff?**
AI and ML can automate and accelerate routine tasks, but in the greater view, AI intent is to replace human security staff, but rather to filter out the noise and raise the key decision points for humans to decide.

**To which extent people are most often the problem in most cybersecurity incidents?**
There are plenty of studies that say humans are the cause of cybersecurity incidents, but it needs to be broken down into misconfigurations, phished users, etc. It has to be broken down into the various threat categories and applied to the systems via tailored threat modelling so it can be addressed; whether that be training users to not click links or open attchments or slowing down the engineering process to include more thorough security reviews, etc.

What will be the biggest obstacle for security leaders to overcome in 2023 and years ahead?
Moving to the cloud is still just barely beginning and embedding the security in that transition is critical. And obviously emerging technologies that allow businesses to set themselves apart from the competition will come with their own new security challenges (IoT, RPA, etc).
