**Social engineering definition**

Social engineering is the art of exploiting human psychology, rather than technical hacking techniques, to gain access to buildings, systems or data.

**Social engineering techniques**

Social engineering has proven to be a very successful way for a criminal to "get inside" your organization. Once a social engineer has a trusted employee's password, he can simply log in and snoop around for sensitive data.

You don't need to go thrift store shopping to pull off a social engineering attack, though. They work just as well over e-mail, the phone, or social media. What all of the attacks have in common is that they use human nature to their advantage, preying on our greed, fear, curiosity, and even our desire to help others.

Social engineers also take advantage of breaking news events, holidays, pop culture, and other devices to lure victims. Scammers often use fake charities to further their criminal goals around the holidays.

Attackers will also customize phishing attacks to target known interests that can be leveraged to entice users to click on malware-laced attachments.

**Act like you're in charge.** Most of us are primed to respect authority - or, as it turns out, to respect people who act like they have the authority to do what they're doing. You can exploit varying degrees of knowledge of a company's internal processes to convince people that you have the right to be places or see things that you shouldn't, or that a communication coming from you is really coming from someone they respect.

**Social engineering prevention**

Security awareness training is the number one way to prevent social engineering. Employees should be aware that social engineering exists and be familiar with the most commonly used tactics.

Social engineering awareness lends itself to storytelling. And stories are much easier to understand and much more interesting than explanations of technical flaws. Quizzes and attention-grabbing or humorous posters are also effective reminders about not assuming everyone is who they say they are.

**Train and train again when it comes to security awareness.** Ensure that you have a comprehensive security awareness training program in place that is regularly updated to address both the general phishing threats and the new targeted cyberthreats. Remember, this is not just about clicking on links.

**Provide a detailed briefing on the latest online fraud techniques to key staff.** Include senior executives, but don't forget anyone who has authority to make wire transfers or other financial transactions.

**Review existing processes, procedures and separation of duties for financial transfers and other important transactions.** Add extra controls, if needed. Remember that separation of duties and other protections may be compromised at some point by insider threats, so risk reviews may need to be reanalyzed given the increased threats.

**Consider new policies related to "out of band" transactions or urgent executive requests.** An email from the CEO's gmail account should automatically raise a red flag to staff, but they need to understand the latest techniques being deployed by the dark side. You need authorized emergency procedures that are well-understood by all.

Review, refine and test your incident management and phishing reporting systems. Run a tabletop exercise with management and with key personnel on a regular basis. Test controls and reverse-engineer potential areas of vulnerability.

Currently, the best defense against social engineering attacks is user education and layers of technological defenses to better detect and respond to attacks.
