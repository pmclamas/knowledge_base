**MISP - Malware Information Sharing Platform**

MISP is an open-source threat information platform that facilitates the collection, storage and distribution of threat intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) related to malware, cyber attacks, financial fraud or any intelligence within a community of trusted members.

Information sharing follows a distributed model. Additionally, the threat information can be distributed and consumed by Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), log analysis tools and Security Information and Event Management Systems (SIEM).

**MISP is effectively useful for the following cases:**
- ***Malware Reverse Engineering -*** sharing of malware indicators to understand how different malware familiies function.
- ***Security Investigations -*** searching, validating and using indicators in investigating security breaches.
- ***Intelligence Analysis -*** gathering information about adversary groups and their capabilities.
- ***Law Enforcement -*** using indicators to support forensic investigations.
- ***Risk Analysis -*** researching new threats, their likelihood and occurrences.
- ***Fraud Analysis -*** sharing of financial indicators to detect financial fraud.

**What does MISP support?**
- ***IOC database -*** this allows for the storage of technical and non-technical information about malware samples, incidents, attackers and intelligence.
- ***Automatic Correlation -*** identification of relationships between attributes and indicators from malware, attack campaigns or analysis.
- ***Data Sharing -*** this allows for sharing of information using different models of distributions and among different MISP instances.
- ***Import & Export features -*** this allows the import and export of events in different formats to integrate other systems such as NIDS, HIDS, and OpenIOC.
- ***Event Graph -*** showcases the relationships between objects and attributes identified from events.
- ***API support -*** supports integration with own systems to fetch and export events and intelligence.

*The following terms are commonly used within MISP and are related to the functionalities described above and the general usage of the platform:*
- *Events -* collection of contextually linked information.
- *Attributes -* individual data points associated with an event, such as network or system indicators.
- *Objects -* custom attribute compositions.
- *Object references -* relationships between different objects.
- *Sightings -* time-specific occurrences of a given data point or attribute detected to provide more credibility.
- *Tags -* labels attached to events/attributes.
- *Taxonomies -* classification libraries are used to tag, classify and organise information.
- *Galaxies -* knowledge base items used to label events/attributes.
- *Indicators -* pieces of information that can detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity.
