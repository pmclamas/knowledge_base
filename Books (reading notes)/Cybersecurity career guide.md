### 1: Exploring cybersecurity careers
##### **What is cybersecurity?**
Cybersecurity is an extension of what is often still referred to as Information Security. 

In 1961, researchers at MIT created the first password-protected system known as the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). For many, this is considered the birthplace of Information Security, which is the practice of protecting information and the electronic systems that process it from unauthorised access.

***A reasonable working definition of cybersecurity is the domain of research, technologies, and practices used to protect connected technology systems, data, and people from attack, unauthorised use, and/or damage.***

From securing elections, to national/international security, to individual online privacy protection, cybersecurity is the common thread responsible for ensuring that all aspects of society function without disruption.

Cybersecurity becomes a crucial input to the risk management process within an organisation. Cybersecurity practitioners are often looked to for their expertise in assessing the level of risk to specific business assets from the various threats that could target those assets. This creates responsibilities for security teams that go beyond just technological capability. Security staff must be able to understand the threat landscape and effectively communicate the characteristics of those threats to other areas of the business that don't have the same level of technical knowledge. Security staff must also be able to understand how assets fit within the overall business in order to more accurately describe the risks that threats pose to the business.

Since IT systems have become such an intrinsic part of the business model, their criticality to businesses has increased as well. A failure of a system that makes it unavailable for use can have enormous impact on a business. Because of the criticality of these systems, which in our modern age are typically interconnected in some way, cybersecurity also plays a role in ensuring the stability and availability of those systems. 
In cybersecurity, teams that focus on the day-to-day functioning of security defences are referred to as security operations teams.

**Examples of day-to-day responsibilities in cybersecurity:**
- monitoring for attacks across various systems
- responding to successful attacks that breach  system or systems
- assessing systems and people for security weaknesses (known as vulnerabilities)
- tracking, validating, and reporting on the fixing of those vulnerabilities
- working with developers on practices for developing secure software
- designing and deploying security measures (also known as controls)
- working with executive leaders to secure budgeting for security
- providing evidence of security controls for auditors
- maintaining various security systems (user accounts, firewalls, ...)

The level of government regulation and industry compliance requirements surrounding the use of IT systems has grown at a breakneck pace. Many of these regulations and compliance standards include detailed requirements for the way organisations secure their systems, respond to breaches or data exposures, and go about protecting consumer privacy.
Cybersecurity employees within an organisation play an important role in the way the company achieves, maintains, and demonstrates compliance with these various regulations and standards.
- digest and even interpret what the requirements actually mean.
- designing and implementing the various controls that will ultimately ensure the organisation's compliance with these requirements. These controls can take the form of processes, practices, policies, and technologies that are all intended to help the organisation protect its data and systems sufficiently according to the requirements.


The daily lives of individual citizens around the globe are completely intertwined with connected technology. From social media, to electronic communications, to mobile apps and even so-called smart devices, human beings on this planet have largely become inseparable from technology. Many who use these technologies are unfamiliar with practices for using them securely and not exposing themselves to attack. As a result, security researchers and professionals are looked to for their expertise.
- increasing security awareness.
- developing and implementing countermeasures or even identifying security vulnerabilities in consumer electronics and software.

**The cybersecurity culture**
- privacy and liberty
- open information sharing
- do no harm
	- Ethos of 'do no harm': formalised rules of engagement for testing systems, ensuring that while vulnerabilities would be discovered, they would not be exploited in a way that caused damage to a system or a person.

**The human element**
An often-cited idea within the security community is that the human element is most often the weakest link. No matter how strong our defences, no matter how good the technology, a single mistake made by a human being can still enable a malicious actor to complete an attack.
Experts focused on human behaviours and awareness training have become crucial elements in this type of security strategy. These experts focus on reshaping the way humans react to attempted social engineering attacks such as phishing, phone fraud, or even in-person manipulations. 

The inclusion of defending the human element against attack further broadens the idea of what cybersecurity is. It forces us to think beyond just technology and really consider inherent behavioural patterns, manipulation techniques, and disinformation countermeasures.

##### Summary
- cybersecurity is the domain of research, technologies, and practices aimed at protecting connected technology systems, data, and people from attack, unauthorised use, and/or damage.
- cybersecurity's role changes with context, but in our digital world of interconnectedness, it's about protecting our way of life.
- cybersecurity can benefit greatly from diversity of experiences and cultures, and the community continues to work to improve the lack of diversity.

### 2. The cybersecurity career landscape
**The many disciplines of cybersecurity**

**High-level disciplines in cybersecurity:**
- Security operations
- Security architecture and design
- Application, software, and product security
- Education and awareness
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- Security assessment and verification
- Governance and compliance
No universally accepted mapping exists of these roles and categories. Professionals across the cybersecurity community have made countless efforts to diagram and document the various roles. Since the technology and our approaches continue to change, so do the roles and the way we choose to categorise them.

**Security Operations**
Day-to-day systems management, monitoring, triage, and initial response to incoming attacks.
Skills tend to be wide ranging as they're ultimately responsible for maintaining security posture across all technologies within an organisation.
The responsibilities within security operations therefore are wide reaching. At the core of security operations is typically the Security Operations Center (SOC). This group (and often location) is dedicated to constant monitoring of systems for signs of security-related events. When a potential event is detected, these resources must triage it to determine whether it represents an attack and then initiate the proper response when necessary. 
However, Security Operations can extend beyond just the SOC. Often, administration of basic security controls within the organisation fall under security operations. These roles might be filled by a security help desk. Ultimately, they're responsible for day-to-day maintenance activities like user account administration and desktop security software management.
Those responsible for maintaining a particular defence technology may interact with the SOC and the help desk but bear the responsibility of actually maintaining and configuring those defences. 
When an alert event turns out to be an attack, they may need to engage the incident response team to provide a more sophisticated response to the problem.
They also need to be aware of the current threat landscape, because receiving regular information from threat intelligence resources is crucial.

For many who are looking to begin a career in cybersecurity, Security Operations is where they start. Security Operations roles often work with automated systems and repeatable tasks that lend themselves well to on-the-job learning and training. Additionally, individuals in these roles can easily leverage previous IT experience in their daily job functions. 
Finally, because of the nature of the role and the wide-ranging responsibilities over various forms of technology, security operations is a terrific way to gain exposure to a lot of technologies and concepts in cybersecurity.

**Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**
Whereas the SOC is responsible for evaluating potential incoming attacks and taking initial steps to defend against them, they will typically escalate to incident response personnel if a more coordinated and specialised level of response is needed.
Incident Response (IR) personnel are ultimately called upon to provide a coordinated and highly methodical response to security incidents.
The organisation's size, security capabilities, regulatory landscape, business model, and more can all be factors in the way an organisation defines its process for responding to security incidents.
The criteria for what constitutes an incident along with the process for responding to an incident is often documented in an incident response plan. It provides the steps for reporting potential incidents, the IR team's response process, ...
Many skills are useful for a role in Incident Response:
- experience with networking;
- software development;
- wireless communications.

In some organisations, the IR team might also be responsible for Digital Forensics, while in others, these two roles are separate.

Digital Forensics refers to investigating the facts of a security incident, often after the incident has been resolved.
Digital Forensics involves reviewing evidence found on systems to determine how an attack occurred and which data and systems it impacted. Digital Forensics personnel are also responsible for identifying, documenting, preserving, and providing expert opinion on evidence that is collected from the various systems involved in an attack.
All this means that a wide-ranging set of skills is needed:
- understanding low-level system behaviours can be crucial;
- understanding the chain of custody and other evidence-handling concepts.
- Detail oriented and able to write effective documentation on a regular basis.

While DFIR roles don't tend to be entry level, experienced professionals from outside the security community can often still be well qualified for a role in DFIR.

**Security architecture and design**
Responsible for specifying, designing, and typically implementing security controls and technologies. These roles are often held by individuals who are familiar with a wide range of security technologies, from firewalls and end-point protection to security incident and event management (SIEM) solutions.
Personnel in these roles need to be able to interact with non-security and often nontechnical roles to ensure that their designs and security architecture meet the needs of the business.
The security architect is responsible for not just defining requirements and designing a security solution, but also communicating that solution to various levels of the organisation, in order to get funding and support. This often requires bridging a gap between technical expertise and business acumen.

**Security assessment and verification**
When people think of cybersecurity, the first image in their minds is often that of a Penetration Tester (previously referred to as an Ethical Hacker). While this role does fall within assessment and verification, the discipline comprises many roles beyond just penetration testing.
Security assessment and verification includes the domain of activities that focus on confirming  the security posture of an organisation by attempting to identify and eliminate security weaknesses. This includes activities that not only seek to find vulnerabilities but also to provide tracking of known weaknesses to ensure they're properly prioritised and addressed. The scope of these activities can include networks, infrastructure components, software, OSINT, physical security.
- **Vulnerability scanning**
	- *Description:* periodic automated scanning of an organisation's environment for security weaknesses.
	- *Goals:* provide regular security verification across a wide breadth of the IT infrastructure.
- **Penetration testing**
	- *Description:* assessing the defined scope of IT systems by using attacker-style techniques usually consisting of both automated tools and hands-on technical hacking.
	- *Goals:* gain a comprehensive view of the security vulnerabilities within the target systems with deeper capability and intelligence than a vulnerability scan.
- **Red Teaming**
	- Description: attacking a defined scope of IT systems in an attempt to achieve a specific objective by using attacker-style techniques while evading detection.
	- Goals: emulate what a real attack may look like for understanding the true risk presented by vulnerabilities in the environment. 
- Purple Teaming
	- Description: similar to Red Teaming, but adding collaboration with the teams responsible for detecting and defending against an attack (Blue Team).
	- Goals: emulate what a real attack may look like to determine and redefine the ability of security controls to repel or recover from an attack.
- Social Engineering
	- Description: using deception and human psychology to attempt to convince personnel to expose sensitive data or provide access to sensitive resources. Usually done via simulated phishing and/or vishing attacks.
	- Goals: determine how personnel within an organisation respond to attempted manipulation and to build greater awareness of proper security practices.
- Physical Security
	- Description: attempting to bypass physical controls without being detected to achieve access to sensitive areas or items. Typically includes social engineering components (often in-person interactions) as well.
	- Goals: emulate attempts to gain unauthorised access to facilities in order to validate that physical controls and personnel responses can sufficiently repel such attempts.
- OSINT audits
	- Description: investigating public sources of information, looking for sensitive information about the organisation or its people.
	- Goals: evaluate whether sensitive data is being exposed in the public domain by business practices or personnel.

The activities involved in assessment and verification represent a wide range of skills. When we look at penetration testing, red teaming, and purple teaming, clearly a great deal of technical knowledge is needed.
These roles require the ability to identify indications that a vulnerability may exist and an understanding of exploitation techniques to verify and potentially exploit discovered vulnerabilities.
The target systems may be network devices, operating systems, systems software, or application software.

A crucial component for any organisation is vulnerability management: the processes and systems used to catalog, prioritise, and ensure remediation of security vulnerabilities within an organisation. 

**Application, software, and product security**
Application security commonly describes how organisation's ensure the security of software they've developed.
Software security is used as a way to describe security round any form of software used within the organisation.
Product security refers to securing any products, whether they're software or hardware based. 

Application security is well understood as applying security practices within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
Finding and fixing security flaws early in application development is cheaper and more effective than if the flaws aren't discovered until the software has hit production.

Since it was introduced in 2008, DevOps has challenged security to remain an effective part of the software delivery pipeline.
As security practitioners have sought to keep security practices integrated into the early stages of software development, the idea of DevSecOps has emerged.

Technical skills are important within the application, software, and product security:
- understanding how software and products are developed, down to a code or component level, is extremely beneficial for these roles.

**Governance and compliance**
Organisations are increasingly regulated by industry and legal requirements. Additionally, most organisations have internal policies and standards that describe required security controls, processes, and technologies.
It is the job of governance and compliance personnel to ensure that all the areas of the organisation are compliant with external regulations and internal policies.

Governance and compliance work more with the administrative side of the organisation. Interaction with legal and audit functions is common within the governance and compliance discipline. They're called upon to assess the organisation's current level of compliance, perform gap analysis, and work with internal and external auditors to demonstrate compliance in regular reviews.

**Leaders and Executives (e.g. CISO)**
Security leaders and executives typically represent the culmination of experience within one or often multiple disciplines of cybersecurity. As the roles become more senior, these leaders need to have at least a conceptual understanding of the various functions for which they will be responsible. 
The CISO role is often the pinnacle of a cybersecurity career. This role is responsible for all things related to cybersecurity across a large division or even the entire breadth of an organisation. The CISO needs to be able to apply knowledge of cybersecurity domains as well as business management to situations that they will encounter on a daily basis. The CISO also needs to understand how other business executives operate and how cybersecurity fits into each of their perspectives. 
These roles are not for everyone. Individuals who have a desire to understand and work in business management as much as security management will fit best in these higher-level leadership roles. They require a unique mix of technical capabilities and business administration knowledge.
While demanding, these roles can also be rewarding. Having ultimate ownership and accountability for the security strategy of an organisation is exciting. It is one way that a cybersecurity professional can build a legacy.

##### Characteristics of a security professional
- **Inventors and creators**
- **Obsessively inquisitive:** when presented with a problem, security professionals need to be motivated to dig in and do their own investigation. Whether it's responding to a potential security alert, assessing an application for a particular vulnerability, or trying to determine whether a company is fully compliant with the requirements of recently passed regulations, security professionals need to be deeply curious.
  The answers we seek are not always easy to find, so our curiosity needs to border on obsessive. Being willing to dive down the "rabbit hole" and investigate a situation until you find an answer is a common quality among the highly respected security professionals.
  This persistence in working through frustrations along the way ultimately yields powerful results. 
  This level of curiosity is found in individuals who are ready, willing, and able to learn new things. As technology grows at increasingly high rates, continuous learning is a must.
