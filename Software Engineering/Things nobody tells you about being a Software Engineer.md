There is a big difference between "programming" and working as a professional software engineer.

Here are, in no particular order, some things that nobody tells you about working in tech as a software engineer:

-   It is normal to have more lines of tests than production code.
-   That you spend a ridiculous amount of time setting up builds, releases, and general tooling. Sometimes as much or more time that you spend coding.
-   That your gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, weight might (will!) have an impact on the perceived quality of the software you build. In other words, that this is not really a meritocracy, and doing a good job is not nearly enough).
-   That writing code is only a small part of what goes into shipping production software.
-   That so much of your work life would be subordinate to the choices of barely-clued-in VCs, and overwhelmed first-time founders with no industry experience.
-   That everything old is continuously made new again.
-   That having decent people skills makes my technical skills suspect, in the eyes of some.
-   That learning to manage your own energy and mindset is the most important skills through gnarly debugging and hairy code reviews alike.
-   That you can have more than a 100% base salary difference doing the same job, depending on if you work at a small startup or one of the large companies.
-   That not all software engineering roles have the same cachet in the eyes of the local culture.
-   That the idea that working at a small startup will make you rich is outdated. You can save up more easily if you work for a bigger, stable company.
-   That the best technology doesn't necessarily win. In fact, it often doesn't.
-   That I would be this suspicious when the tests pass on first try, and have to invert my assertions to force a test failure and convince myself that things are working as intended. (Aside: why is this not a standard feature of testing frameworks? I want some way to re-run tests flipping some of the assertions, to make sure they are testing what I think they are.)
