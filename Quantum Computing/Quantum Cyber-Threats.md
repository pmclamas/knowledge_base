Significant differences between quantum and classical computing, both in operations and possibilities. One of the most significant of these is that while classical computers only have binary choices, 0 or 1, quantum computers are made up of 'qubits', which "can have values that are combinations of 0 and 1." This mixture is known as a 'superposition'.
This enables calculations to be made in parallel. In addition, qubits can be connected, which provides the opportunity to model aspects of nature in their entirety. This aspect offers enormous potential in fields like drug discovery, where testing could be simulated rather than requiring lengthy and expensive trials.

"It's unlikely that one technology will emerge as the best answer in every situation. I think in the years ahead, we'll have different types of quantum computers for different purposes."

Quantum poses significant dangers in cyberspace. In particular, in the next 10-15 years, it is expected to be able to break existing cryptography algorithms such as RSA, Elliptic curve cryptography and Diffie-Hellman key exchange. 
This will impact numerous everyday systems, including public key infrastructure (PKI), HTTP/TLS, network security, payments, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain.

Quantum does not just represent a future cyber-threat but nevertheless is very relevant today. This is the concept of "hack now, decrypt later". In this scenario, a hacker will listen in to and record an encrypted exchange today, which they can decrypt retrospectively on a quantum computer in the future. Therefore, "perfect forward secrecy doesn't help you here because the attacker can see all the messages that were exchanged, and a quantum computer will be able to break the mathematics protecting that exchange." This issue is particularly pertinent to data that will still be relevant in 10-15 years. "Quantum attacks may well already started."

Quantum poses huge dangers to IoT devices. This is because these devices have a secure boot mechanism baked into the silicon that cannot be upgraded, leaving many of these devices vulnerable to quantum attacks. 

There are actions security teams can take now to secure their systems against the threat of quantum.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ongoing process to identify new algorithms "that we don't think a quantum computer can solve any better than a classical computer". It is currently at round three, a stage that will decide the algorithms selected for standardization.

How security teams can migrate to post-quantum cryptography:
There are a lot of steps ahead of us. NIST believes full implementation of a new crypto standard will take a decade or more. For now, teams should be focusing on understanding the cryptography they are using, the highest-value assets in their organization and the assets most vulnerable to being recorded today and decrypted later.
