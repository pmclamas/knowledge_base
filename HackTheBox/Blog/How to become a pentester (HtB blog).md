Pentesters simulate cyber attacks to help companies learn where there are security vulnerabilities in their computers and networks. They must work within the scope the company they’re working for gives them, and they’re only permitted to simulate cyber attacks in ways that their client authorizes. The difference between a real cyber attack and a pentest is consent.

**Explore Bug Bounty programs**

Bug bounty programs are a great way to demonstrate your application pentesting abilities. Successful bug bounties also look great on a pentester’s resume.

HackerOne features a comprehensive list of bug bounty programs that you can check out. Hack The Box has also collaborated with HackerOne to launch the Bug Bounty Hunter job role path. It’s full of HTB Academy modules that will teach you how to become a master bug bounty hunter.

“Hacker for hire” programs are a great way to get introduced to the real pentesting world, by exploring diverse enterprise infrastructure. Try it out, even part time, see if you like it and help companies be more secure while earning a living.

**Start learning with Hacking Labs and HTB Academy**

HTB Hacking Labs offer a fully interactive pentester training environment. You can exploit vulnerable machines at a variety of skill levels, from Easy to Insane difficulty. You can also track your progress and show off what you have accomplished.

HTB Academy features a wide and growing collection of fully interactive cybersecurity training courses, many of which are specially designed to teach you about various areas of pentesting.

Start with [Cracking into Hack The Box Job Path first](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/cracking-into-hack-the-box). Then move onto the [Junior Penetration Tester Job Path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/junior-penetration-tester).

Hacking Labs offer an exploratory, fully hands-on type of learning experience, the “learn by doing” method. HTB Academy, on the other hand, takes a more guided approach through interactive training modules and learning paths that combine theory with practice.

**Get practical and real-world pentesting training with Pro Labs**

Hackers who succeed in Hacking Labs can progress to [Pro Labs](https://www.hackthebox.com/hacker/pro-labs). Pro Labs feature realistic enterprise network scenarios. You’ll be hacking multiple machines rather than one at a time. When you’re ready to start Pro Labs, we recommend Dante first. It’s your Penetration Tester I Level. From there, you can tackle Offshore, Penetration Tester II Level, and then move onto increasingly challenging Pro Labs. You will earn a certificate for completing each Pro Lab.

**Get hired**

Once you’ve made progress in our Labs and HTB Academy, you can use Hack The Box credentials to find your first pentester job! We have a cybersecurity [job portal](https://www.hackthebox.com/hacker/infosec-careers). Many top employers look for pentesters here, including Dell, AWS, and many more.
