There is a maturity curve when it comes to intelligence represented by the three levels listed above. With each level, the context and analysis of CTI becomes deeper and more sophisticated, caters to different audiences, and can get more costly.

##### Tactical Threat Intelligence
*Challenge :* organisations often only focus on singular threats.
*Objective :* obtain a broader perspective of threats in order to combat the underlying problem.
Tactical Intelligence is focused on the immediate future, is technical in nature, and identifies simple indicators of compromise (IOCs). IOCs are things such as bad IP addresses, URLs, file hashes and known malicious domain names. It can be ingested through feeds or API integration.
Tactical Intelligence is almost always automated, but is usually has a very short lifespan because IOCs such as malicious IPs or domain names can become obsolete in days or even hours.

##### Operational Threat Intelligence
*Challenge:* threat actors favours techniques that are effective, opportunistic, and low-risk.
*Objective:* engage in campaign tracking and actor profiling to gain a better understanding of the adversaries behind the attacks.
Behind every attack is a "who", "why", and "how". 
The "who" is called attribution. The "why" is called motivation or intent. The "how" is made up of the TTPs the threat actor employs. Together these factors provide context, and context provides insight into how adversaries plan, conduct, and sustain campaigns and major operations.
Machines alone cannot create operational threat intelligence. While operational intelligence requires more resources than tactical intelligence, it has a longer useful life because adversaries can't change their TTPs as easily as they can change their tools, such as a specific type of malware or infrastructure.
Operational intelligence is most useful for those cybersecurity professionals who work in a SOC and are responsible for performing day-to-day operations. 
Cybersecurity disciplines such as vulnerability management, incident response and threat monitoring are the biggest consumers of operational intelligence as it helps make them more proficient and more effective at their assigned functions.

##### Strategic Threat Intelligence
*Challenge:* poor business and organisational decisions are made when the adversary is misunderstood
*Objective:* threat intelligence should inform business decisions and the processes behind them.
Adversaries don't operate in a vacuum - in fact, there are almost always higher level factors that surround the execution of cyber attacks. 
Strategic intelligence shows how global events, foreign policies, and other long-term local and international movements can potentially impact the cyber security of an organisation.
Strategic intelligence tends to be the hardest form to generate. Strategic intelligence requires human data collection and analysis that demands an intimate understanding of both cybersecurity and the nuances of the world's geopolitical situation. Strategic intelligence usually comes in the form of reports.
