**Want to work on cybersecurity?**
-   Have a strong skill related to information technology, coding, networks, etc.
-   Learn how to do that securely
-   Learn to defend, detect, and respond to attacks on it.
-   Do not focus solely on "ethical hacking".

Entry-level roles often involve getting experience on defense (Blue Team) and preventing attacks rather than starting them.

You'll get started with an anlyst role and work with companies to prevent attacks.

Most "red team/offensive roles" that involve penetration testing are handled by agencies or external teams these days. Even companies that hire internal teams to do that work expect you to have played defense for some years before you're part of an offensive team.

Certifications related to the offensive side such as the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) are often given out with years of work experience as a prerequesite. You need a minimum of 2 years of security-related experience to even test for the CEH, for example.

**Look for Security Operations Centers Analyst roles**

SOC analyst roles are a good way to break into the cybersecurity industry. Security operations centers need analysts to parse through different threats. This entry-level role can be a good way to demonstrate your capabilities before moving on to more advanced roles.

You'll need technical knowledge, but the depth of experience required here isn't so deep.

Be familiar with SQL, Python, web applications and the terminal.

SOC analyst roles are generally regarded as a good entry-level position for people looking to pivot and transition deeper into a cybersecurity career.

**Practice your scripting skills, especially with Linux**

In order to be fully effective in cybersecurity, understanding how to code and systematically look through logs is essential.

It's good to know how to programmatically work and analyze the flood of data that comes with it. This will involve getting comfortable with the terminal, working on Python and shell scripts, and other programming skills.

In general, you'll want to be strong enough with Linux commands or other terminal commands to do the following:

1.  View critical system information and status
2.  Be able to detect running processes and programs and start/stop them.
3.  Install software and be able to update it securely (configuration of automatic installation may be required).
4.  Connect into remote systems using tools such as SSH.
5.  Go through events logs and be able to systematically understand what is happening to a system.
6.  Set up event logs in such a way that you can be maximally efficient at responding to threats.
7.  View how the network is set up and make changes as needed, and make system changes as needed as well.

BASH scripts are useful for interacting with the terminal in a more systematic way.

**Learn commonly used Cybersecurity tools**

Main tool to learn: Kali Linux

Few examples of other tools for the cybersecurity analyst level:

1.  _**NMap**_ is an open source tool that lets you easily map out different network ports, and allows you to do basic vulnerability scanning.
2.  _**Wireshark**_ lets you sniff packets of information from a network. You can use ti to break down real-time data on a live network, giving you detailed information on the data passing within a network.
3.  _**John The Ripper**_ is password cracker meant to detect when there are weak Unix passwords. This is an important check to make sure that users with admin privileges have secure accounts so that an external attacker cannot have access to system privileges they would need to escalate an attack.
4.  Snort is an open source software that allows you to detect network intrusion. It can do live traffic analysis and figure out if there's malicious software on inbound requests, allowing you to more easily defend a network from malicious actors.
5.  Metasploit allows for deeper analysis of the results from tools like Nmap and Wireshark. While it's used primarly as a penetration testing tool, you can use it to lay the foundation for a good network defense. It used to be open-source. You can still use the free community edition to practice getting familiar with it.
