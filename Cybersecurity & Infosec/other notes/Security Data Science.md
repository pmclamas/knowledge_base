Is the application of advanced analytics to access data to uncover unknown risks.

Generally, Data Science is the practice of deriving valuable insights from data. In security, the valuable insight leads to reduced risk.

Security Data Scientists are professionals specialized in data analytics for security and fraud.

The have a broad range of specialities that may include one or more of the following:

-   SIEM development
-   Insider threat detection
-   Computer and networks foresincs
-   Security metrics
-   Governance, risk and compliance
-   Risk modeling
-   Fraud and loss analytics
-   Advanced threat mitigation
-   Malware analysis
-   ... and many more...

Data Science is emerging to meet the challenges of processing very large data sets (Big Data) and the explosion of new data generated from smart devices, web, mobile and social media. Data Science has a long and rich history in Security and Fraud Monitoring.

The Information Security and Fraud Prevention industry have been evolving Security Data Science in order to tackle the challenges of managing and gaining insights from huge streams of log data, discover insider threats and prevent fraud. Security Data Science is "data driven" meaning that new insights and value comes directly from data.

**What makes a [Security] Data Scientist?**

_Curiosity + Intuition + Data gathering + Statistics + Modeling + Visualization_

A Data Scientist is driven by curiosity to explore and experiment with data. Experience in mashing up data from multiple sources helps the Data Scientist develop a keen intuition into what data is relevant to a given set of questions. Experience in cleaning, parsing and deciphering vastly different data types allows the Data Scientist to gather the needed data.

Data Scientists understand how to standardize data into intelligible information and then apply statistics, modeling, and visualization in order to draw insights.

**Role of Data Science in Cybersecurity?**

Modern Data Science is all about understanding. It involves studying, processing, and extracting valuable insights from a set of information.

One modern application of Data Science includes Cybersecurity. It may sound strange to study Data Science with the hopes of improving cybersecurity, but in reality, it makes a lot of sense.

**Relationship between Big Data and Cybersecurity**

With the application of Data Analytics and Machine Learning tools, an organization can conduct thorough analysis of collections of information. Professionals can examine data closely to reveal trends, patterns and actionable intel.

**Predictive and Active Intrusion Detection Systems**

Cybersecurity is really a cat-and-mouse game. Hackers and attackers use a range of tools and intrusion styles to gain access. It is here, intrusion detection systems come into use, both active and preventive variety. These systems monitor users and devices on your network and flags dangerous activity.

Modern Data Science can both enhance and simplify the use of such tools. By feeding present and historical data into a Machine Learning algorithm, this system can precisely detect potential problems. Over time, as such systems become more precise, it can predict future attacks and spot various loopholes.

**Protecting the valuable information**

Another concern of a data attack is the loss of extremely valuable data and information, which can be really damaging to your organization.

With the use of security measures like highly complex signatures or encryption, you can stop anyone from probing into a dataset. By involving Data Science, you can start to build impenetrable protocols. For example, by analyzing the history of your cyber attacks, you can develop algorithms to detect the most frequently targeted chunks of data.

**Overall, Data Science through effective analytics systems help enhance the cybersecurity industry. It allows to come up with more operative, defensive and active measures to prevent cyber attacks.**
