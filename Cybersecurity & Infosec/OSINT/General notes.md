"Be very, very, curious and creative. Be the person that keeps pulling that little thread until you know what's on the other side." #OSINT

"Creativity, perseverance and determination rule above any toolkit available. Take your time to think about how to solve the problem. Follow your instinct, but record/archive what you are doing. Provide feedback to yourself to correct your track and avoid rabbit holes." #OSINT 

"The real skill is methodology." #OSINT 

"OSINT is about curiosity, creativity, sharing and collaborating as well as constant learning." #OSINT 

"Don't be afraid to ask questions of others or to make mistakes as you learn. Set specific targets for your projects if you can. Archive everything that you may need. Don't take what others say as a fact, check it yourself. Always seek context and don't rush to be the first to post about a finding." #OSINT
