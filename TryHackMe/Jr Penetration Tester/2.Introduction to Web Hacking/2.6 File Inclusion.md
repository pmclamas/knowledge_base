**What is File Inclusion?**

In some scenarios, web applications are written to request access to files on a given system, including images, static text, and so on via parameters. Parameters are query parameter strings attached to the URL that could be used to retrieve data or perform actions based on user input.

For example, parameters are used with Google searching, where GET requests pass user input into the search engine.

**Why do File Inclusion vulnerabilities happen?**

File inclusion vulnerabilities are commonly found and exploited in various programming languages for web applications. The main issue of these vulnerabilities is the input validation, in which the user inputs are not sanitized or validated, and the user controls them. When the input is not validated, the user can pass any input to the function, causing the vulnerability.

**What is the risk of File Inclusion?**

If the attacker can use file inclusion vulnerabilities to read sensitive data. In that case, the successful attack causes to leak of sensitive data, including code and files related to the web application, credentials for back-end systems. Moreover, if the attacker somehow can write to the server such as /tmp directory, then it is possible to gain remote command execution RCE. However, it won’t be effective if file inclusion vulnerability is found with no access to sensitive data and no writing ability to the server.

**Path Traversal**

Also known as Directory Traversal, a web security vulnerability allows an attacker to read operating system resources, such as local files on the server running an application. The attacker exploits this vulnerability by manipulating and abusing the web application’s URL to locate and access files or directories stored outside the application’s root directory.

Path traversal vulnerabilities occur when the user’s input is passed to a function such as file_get_contents. It’s important to note that the function is not the main contributor to the vulnerability. Often poor input validation or filtering is the cause of the vulnerability.

We can test out the URL parameter by adding payloads to see how the web application behaves. Path traversal attacks, also known as the dot-dot-slash attack, take advantage of moving the directory one step up using the double dots (../). If the attacker finds the entry point, then the attacker may send something.

Sometimes, developers will add filters to limit access to only certain files or directories. Below are some common OS file you could use when testing.

-   _**/etc/issue -**_ contains a message or system identification to be printed before the login prompt.
-   _**/etc/profile -**_ controls system-wide default variables, such as Export variables, File creation mask (umask), Terminal types, Mail messages to indicate when new mail has arrived.
-   _**/proc/version -**_ specifies the version of the Linux kernel.
-   _**/etc/passwd -**_ has all registered users that has access to a system.
-   _**/etc/shadow -**_ contains information about the system’s users’ passwords.
-   _**/root/.bash_history -**_ contains the history commands for root user
-   _**/var/log/dmessage -**_ contains global system messages, including the messages that are logged during system startup.
-   _**/var/mail/root -**_ all emalis for root user.
-   _**/root/.ssh/id_rsa -**_ private ssh keys for a root or any known valid user on the server.
-   _**/var/log/apache2/access.log -**_ the accessed requests for Apache webserver.
-   _**C:\boot.ini -**_ contains the boot options for computers with BIOS firmware.

**Local File Inclusion (LFI)**

LFI attacks against web applications are often due to a developers’ lack of security awareness.

**Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**

Is a technique to include remote files and into a vulnerable application. Like LFI, The RFI occurs when improperly sanitizing user input, allowing an attacker to inject an external URL into ‘inlcude’ function. One requirement for RFI is that the ‘allow_url_fopen’ option needs to be ‘on’.

The risk of RFI is higher than LFI since RFI vulnerabilities allow an attacker to gain Remote Command Execution (RCE) on the server. Other consequences of a successful RFI attack include:

-   Sensitive Information Disclosure
-   Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
-   Denial of Service (DoS)

An external server must communicate with the application server for a successful RFI attack where the attacker hosts malicious files on their server. Then the malicious file is injected into the include function via HTTP requests, and the content of the malicious file executes on the vulnerable application server.

**Remediation**

As a developer, it’s important to be aware of web application vulnerabilities, how to find them, and prevention methods. To prevent the file inclusion vulnerabilities, some common suggestions include:

-   Keep system and services, including web application frameworks, updated with the latest version.
-   A web application Firewall (WAF) is a good option to help mitigate web application attacks.
-   Never trust user input, and make sure to implement proper input validation against file inclusion.
-   Implement whitelisting for files names and locations as well as blacklisting.
