[Join our Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/hRXnCFA) and [forum](https://forum.hackthebox.eu/). We normally disclose the latest updates and new features on Discord first.

**Step 3: Build your own hacking VM (or use Pwnbox)**

In order to begin your hacking journey with the platform, let’s start by setting up your own hacking machine. It will be a virtual environment running on top of your base operating system to be able to play and practice with Hack The Box. (This is the most important step for every hacker in the making.)

You can make it quick and easy by installing one of the following virtualization applications:

-   VMWare Workstation Player
-   Oracle VirtualBox

After installing your preferred virtualization software, select your operating system of choice:

-   Kali Linux
-   [Parrot OS](https://parrotsec.org/)

**Pwnbox** is a Hack The Box customized ParrotOS VM hosted in the cloud. It can be accessed via any web browser. It’s HTB customized and maintained, and you can hack all HTB labs directly. [Intro to Pwnbox](https://help.hackthebox.eu/machines-challenges/v2-pwnbox).
