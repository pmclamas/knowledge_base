##### Introduction
We will learn three command-line tools:
- 'whois' to query WHOIS servers
- 'nslookup' to query DNS servers
- 'dig' to query DNS servers
We use 'whois' to query WHOIS records, while we use 'nslookup' and 'dig' to query DNS database records. These are all publicly available records and hence do not alert the target.
We will also learn the usage of two online services:
- DNSDumpter
- Shodan.io
These two online services allow us to collect information about our target without directly connecting to it.

##### Passive Vs. Active Recon
"If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt". Sun Tzu

If you are playing the role of an attacker, you need to gather information about your target systems. If you are playing the role of a defender, you need to know what your adversary will discover about your systems and networks.

Reconnaissance (recon) can be defined as a preliminary survey to gather information about a target. It is the first step in The Unified Kill Chain to gain an initial foothold on a system. We divide reconnaissance into:
1. Passive Reconnaissance
2. Active Reconnaissance

In passive reconnaissance, you rely on publicly available knowledge. It is the knowledge that you can access from publicly available resources without directly engaging with the target.
Passive reconnaissance activities include many activities, for instance:
- Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
- Checking job ads related to the target website.
- Reading news articles about the target company.

Active reconnaissance, on the other hand, cannot be achieved so discreetly. It requires direct engagement with the target. 
Examples of active reconnaissance activities include:
- Connecting to one of the company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
- Calling the company in an attempt to get information (social engineering).
- Entering company premises pretending to be a repairman.

**WHOIS**
Is a request and response protocol. A WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests. The domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names it is leasing. The WHOIS server replies with various information related to the domain requested. Of particular interest, we can learn:
- Registrar: via which registrar was the domain name registered?
- Contact info of registrant: Name, organisation, address, phone, among other things (unless made hidden via a privacy service).
- Creation, update, and expiration dates: when was the domain name first registered? When was it last updated? And when does it need to be renewed?
- Name Server: which server to ask to resolve the domain name?

To get this informtion, we need to use a 'whois' client or an online service. You can easily access your whois client on the terminal. The syntax is 'whois DOMAIN_NAME'.

The information collected can be inspected to find new attack surfaces, such as social engineering or technical attacks. For instance, depending on the scope of the penetration test, you might consider an attack against the email server of the admin user or the DNS servers, assuming they are owned by your client and fall within the scope of the penetration test.

**nslookup and dig**
Find the IP address of a domain name using 'nslookup', which stands for Name Server Look Up. You need to issue the command 'nslookup DOMAIN_NAME'. 
Or, more generally, you can use 'nslookup OPTIONS DOMAIN_NAME SERVER'. These three main parameters are:
- "Options" contains the query type as shown in the table below.
![[Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 11.22.43.png]]
- "DOMAIN_NAME" is the domain name you are looking for.
- "SERVER" is the DNS server that you want to query. You can choose any local or public DNS server to query. Cloudfare offers 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1, Google offers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. There are many more public DNS servers that you can choose from if you want alternatives to your ISP's DNS servers.

For more advanced DNS queries and additional functionality, you can use 'dig' (Domain Information Groper), if you are curious.
We can use 'dig DOMAIN_NAME', but to specify the record type, we would use 'dig DOMAIN_NAME TYPE'. Optionally, we can select the server we want to query using 'dig @SERVER DOMAIN_NAME TYPE'.
- SERVER is the DNS server that you want to query.
- DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name you are looking up.
- TYPE contains the DNS record type, as shown in the table provided earlier.

A quick comparison between the output of 'nslookup' and 'dig' shows that 'dig' returned more information, such as the TTL (Time To Live) by default.

**DNSDumpster**
DNS lookup tools, such as nslookup and dig, cannot find subdomains on their own. The domain you are inspecting might include a different subdomain that can reveal much information about the target.

One approach to discover such subdomains would be to rely on brute-forcing queries to find which subdomains have DNS records.
To avoid such a time-consuming search, one can use an online service that offers detailed answers to DNS queries, such as DNSDumpster.
DNSDumpster will return the collected DNS information in easy-to-read tables and a graph. DNSDumpster will also provide any collected information about listening servers.

**Shodan.io**
When you are tasked to run a penetration test against specific targets, as part of the passive reconnaissance phase, a service like Shodan.io can be helpful to learn various pieces of information about the client's network, without actively connecting to it. On the defensive side, you can use different services from Shodan.io to learn about connected and exposed devices belonging to your organization.

Shodan.io tries to connect to every device reachable online to build a search engine of connected "things" in contrast with a search engine for web pages. Once it gets a response, it collects all the information related to the service and saves it in the database to make it searchable.
