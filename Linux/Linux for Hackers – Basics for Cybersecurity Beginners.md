#### Linux File Structure
![[Screenshot 2022-10-15 at 11.04.08.png]]

Some important directories to take not of are:
1. /bin : binary or executable programs (nice place for keeping persistent scripts)
2. /etc : system configuration files (an awesome place to obtain credentials)
3. /home : home directory (the default current directory when you open up the terminal)
4. /opt : optional or third-party software
5. /tmp : temporary space, usually cleared on reboot (a great place to store enumeration scripts)
6. /usr : user related programs
7. /var : log files (the perfect place to frustrate a forensic analyst)

There is a lot more about Linux file structure...
