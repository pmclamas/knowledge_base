Is a facility that houses an Information Security Team responsible for monitoring and analysing an organisation's security posture on an ongoing basis. The SOC team's goal is to detect, analyse, and respond to cyber security incidents using a combination of technology solutions and a strong set of processes.
Security Operations Centers are typically staffed with Security Analysts and engineers as well as managers who oversee security operations.

**SOC Analysts** are the first responders to cyber incidents. They analyse and report cyber threats and then follow the guidelines to protect an organisation.
A SOC Analyst is responsible for mitigating risks, identifying suspicious activity, and protecting online and on-site IT infrastructures. SOC Analysts stand as the first line of defence. Additionally, SOC Analysts generate reports for IT administrators to contribute to the effectiveness of current security protocols. To do this, the SOC Analyst must have up-to-date knowledge and skills of the latest hacking practices and tactics, current intelligence and methods to prevent threats and breaches. A SOC Analyst has knowledge of Malware Analysis, networking, incident response, and cyber security practices. #SOC_Analyst
