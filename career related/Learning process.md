#### Way of  thinking
We do not need to learn every programming language to understand how to read their code.
All of them follow the same principles:
1. The Principle of Abstraction
2. The Principle of Correspondence
3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness.

In Information Security, we have to learn and understand these principles, structures, and processes.
Additionally, we have to adapt our knowledge to the various environments we encounter. We will have many situations where we will not understand how "it" works. That is good. At this point, we have to find out what we do not know.

Penetration Testers must have a deep understanding of a wide variety of technologies. The problem in this field is the sheer volume of information available to us. We can learn about every topic and still not master any one area, or we can learn about just one topic and become an expert in it.

We will be successful if we know how to search for the required information on the internet, and we know how to learn fast and adapt to the environment we are working in. However, before we can do this, we have to learn and practice how to do it.
We will become a good Penetration Tester only through considerable practice. There is no other way to improve our practical skills.

We can read 50 books about programming, and we will understand how to read the code. This is the process of passive learning. This can be useful. However, if we need to write our own program, we have to practice active learning, which means we have to write code and test it on our own.

#### Think outside the box
This art of thinking is an essential part of the "hacker mindset", or the way we must think as Penetration Testers to solve complex problems. Thinking outside the box means seeing things outside of the limitations placed on us. This means we have to be able to "pivot".
We have to focus on so many different technologies during our penetration tests that it can become confusing and frustrating when we do not understand some things.

### *A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.*

In other words, frustration and confusion come with the point of view we are looking at. The learning process is not just a theoretical and practical part. It is also our learning process and progress that largely depends on our emotional state.

Another essential part that makes you successful is that you know your goal. We will overcome the obstacles which are put in your way. If we do not have a goal, we will stop at the first obstacle. Without a goal, we will be disoriented moving from one topic to another.

**Learning efficiency**
The problem is the sheer size of the Information Security field. We have to understand how things work, how they are structured, and how to use them. All of the technical information we need to be successful in this field is already out there.
The primary and most difficult objective we must overcome is the combination of our knowledge, adaptation, and new information.
Another major problem we most solve is handling this massive amount of information and adapting it to our strengths and weaknesses.

We have to fail. It is an unavoidable and essential part of learning. This is one of the parts of the learning process which makes us successful. Experience is built on failures.

Many companies are searching for good Penetration Testers and Information Security Specialists. To be good at something means we know what we are doing. If we know what we are doing, that means that we are experienced with this topic. Experience means we have a vast repertoire in this field. Repertoire comes from associations and practical experience.

We become excellent pretty fast. This is the so-called "Learning curve", including active and passive learning.

**Learning Types**
- ***Passive Learning -*** just by reading, we will learn only about 10% of the whole Penetration Testing experience. By watching some video tutorials, we will not learn more than 30%.
- ***Active Learning -*** when we start to discuss our entire enumeration process, results, and findings with others, we will see different points of view, results, and information to compare with our own and find out what we missed. By using this type of active learning, we collect up to 50% experience. Before we can discuss our results with others, we should practice on our own. So while we practice, our learning experience grows to 75%.

Efficiency depends not only on the quality of information we find but on the usage of that information. Moreover, it depends on our motivation, focus, and goals.

There are many different ways to stay motivated:
- recognise our success and see that we have made progress.
- have a goal. When we know our goal, we know the direction of our actions.

**Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning.**

**Looking back and seeing how far we have come will keep us motivated.**

##### Documentation
The essential characteristics of documentation are:
1. Overview
2. Structure
3. Clarity

##### Organization
Being organised is significant in Penetration Testing because the entire report writing process has to be structured.

##### Focus
When we talk about focus, we are talking about focusing on a subject for a specific time.
It is essential to differentiate between focus and attention because they are not the same.
Attention refers to the momentum, as it is happening right now. However, the focus is on the topic you are dealing with at the moment. Attention is influenced by focus.
The focus is based on our will and what we want to achieve. It can be a conscious decision and a subconscious decision guided by external influences.

Focusing is the purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal.
Focused people are not only enormously persistent and tenacious, but they are also hardly distracted or discouraged.
If we know our goal, it is easier to align our focus accordingly. This, in turn, makes us much more efficient, and we get closer to our goal much faster and do not let ourselves be distracted by external influences.

##### Attention
Attention is the perception of a specific topic with a higher level of interest in order to gather specific data and information from it.
Our attention changes with our experience and the information we gain from the content and its clarity.
Attention is influenced by your interests, needs, personal attitudes, beliefs, orientations, goals, and experiences.
Concentration is the maintenance of our attention on a specific topic.
Attention goes hand in hand with concentration and focus.
