**Yandex** is by far the best reverse image search engine, with a powerful ability to recognize faces, landscapes, and objects. This russian site draws heavily upon user-generated content, such as tourist review sites and social networks, for remarkably accurate results with facial and landscape recognition queries.
Its strengths lie in photographs taken in a European or former-Soviet context. 
To use Yandex, go to images.yandex.com, then choose the camera icon on the right. From there, you can either upload a saved image or type in the URL of one hosted online.

The facial recognition algorithms used by Yandex are shockingly good. Not only will Yandex look for photographs that look similar to the one that hs a face in it, but it will also look for other photographs of the same person (determined through matching facial similarities) with completely different lighting, background colors, and positions.
Yandex is, obviously, a Russian service, and there are worries and suspicions of its ties to the Kremlin. 

**Bing** has caught up to Google in its reverse image search capabilities, but is still limited. Bing's "Visual Search", found at images.bing.com, offers a few interesting features not found elsewhere.
Within a image search, Bing allows you to crop a photograph (button below the source image) to focus on a specific element in said photograph, as seen below. The results with the cropped image will exclude the extraneous elements, focusing on the user-defined box. However, if the selected portion of the image is small, it is worth it to manually crop the photograph yourself and increase the resolution - low-resolution images (below 200x200) bring back poor results.

**Google** is by far the most popular reverse image search engine. Google is fine for most rudimentary reverse image searches. Some of these relatively simple queries include identifying well-known people in photographs, finding the source of images that have been shared quite a bit online, determining the name and creator of a piece of art, and so on. However, if you want to locate images that are not close to an exact copy of the one you are researching, you may be disappointed.

**FlagID.org** will let you manually enter information about a flag to figure out where it comes from.

**Language recognition**, if you are looking at a foreign language with an orthography you don't recognize, try using some OCR or Google Translate to make your life easier. 

**_Some easy tips for reverse image searching:_**
- use Yandex first, second, and third, and then try Bing and Google if you still can't find your desired result.
- If you are working with source imagery that is not from a Western or former Soviet country, then you may not have much luck. These search engines are hyper-focused on these areas, and struggle in South America, Central America/Caribbean, Africa, and much of Asia.
- Increase the resolution of your source image, even if it just means doubling or tripling the resolution until it's a pixelated mess. None of these search engines can do much with an image that is under 200x200.
- Try cropping out elements of the image, or pixelating them if it trips up your results. Most of these search engines will focus on people and their faces like a heat-seeking missile, so pixelate them to focus on the background elements.
- If all else fails, get really creative: mirror your image horizontally, add some color filters, or use the clone tool on your image editor to fill in elements on your image that are disrupting searches.
