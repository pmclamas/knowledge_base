##### What is Repeater?
Burp Suite Repeater allows us to craft and/or relay intercepted requests to a target at will. It means we can take a request captured in the Proxy, edit it, and send the same request repeatedly as many times as we wish. Alternatively, we could craft requests by hand, much as we would from the CLI, using a tool such as CURL to build and send requests.
This ability to edit and resend the same request multiple times makes Repeater ideal for any kind of manual poking around at an endpoint, providing us with a GUI for writing the request payload and numerous views of the response so that we can see the results of our handiwork in action.

**The Repeater interface can be split into six main sections:**
1. At the very top left of the tab, we have a list of Repeater requests. We can have many different requests going through Repeater: each time we send a new request to Repeater, it will appear up here.
2. Directly underneath the request list, we have the controls for the current request. These allows us to send a request, cancel a hanging request, and go forwards/backwards in the request history.
3. Still on the left-hand side of the tab, but taking up most of the window, we have the request and response view. We edit the request in the Request view then press send. The response will show up in the Response view.
4. Above the request/response section, on the right-hand side, is a set of options allowing us to change the layout for the request and response views. By default, this is usually side-by-side; however, we can also choose to put them above/below each other or in separate tabs.
5. At the right-hand side of the window, we have the Inspector, which allows us to break requests apart to analyse and edit them in a slightly more intuitive way than with the raw editor.
6. Finally, above the Inspector we have our target. Quite simply, this is the IP address or domain to which we are sending requests. When we send requests to Repeater from other parts of Burp Suite, this will be filled in automatically.

##### Repeater basic usage
Whilst we can craft requests by hand, it would be much more common to simply capture a request in the Proxy, then send that through to Repeater for editing/resending.
With a request captured in the proxy, we can send to repeater either by right-clicking on the request and choosing "Send to Repeater" or by pressing 'CTRL +R'.
Switching back to Repeater, we can see that our request is now available.

The target and Inspector elements are now also showing information; however, we do not yet have a response. When we click the "Send" button, the Response section quickly populates:

If we want to change anything about the request, we can simply type in the Request window and press "Send" again; this will update the Response on the right. For example, changing the "Connection" header to 'open' rather than 'close' results in a response "Connection" header with a value of 'keep-alive':

##### Repeater Views
Repeater offers us various ways to present the responses to our requests - these range from hex output all the way up to a fully rendered version of the page.
We have four display options:
1. Pretty - this is the default option. It takes the raw response and attempts to beautify it slightly, making it easier to read.
2. Raw - the pure, un-beautified response from the server.
3. Hex - this view takes the raw response and gives us a byte view of it - especially useful if the response is a binary file.
4. Render - the render view renders the page as it would appear in your browser. Whilst not hugely useful given that we would usually be interested in the source code when using Repeater, this is still a neat trick.
In most instances, the "Pretty" option is perfectly adequate; however, it is still well worth knowing how to use the other three options.

##### Repeater - Inspector
Inspector is entirely supplementary to the request and response fields of the Repeater window. If you understand how to read and edit HTTP requests, then you may find that you rarely use Inspector at all.
That said, it is a superb way to get a prettified breakdown of the requests and responses, as well as for experimenting to see how changes made using the higher-level inspector affect the equivalent raw versions.
Inspector can be used in the Proxy as well as Repeater. In both cases, it appears over at the very right hand side of the window and gives us a list of the components in the request and response.
Of these, the request sections can nearly always be altered, allowing us to add, edit, and delete items. For example, in the Request Attributes section, we can edit the parts of the request that deal with location, method and protocol; e.g. changing the resource we are looking to retrieve, altering the request from GET to another HTTP method, or switching protocol from HTTP/1 to HTTP/2.

The other sections available for viewing and/or editing are:
- Query Parameters, which refer to data being sent to the server in the URL.
- Body Parameters, which do the same thing as Query Parameters,  but for POST requests. Anything that we send as data in a POST request will show up in this section, once again allowing us to modify the parameters before re-sending.
- Request Headers allow us to view, access, and modify (including outright adding or removing) any of the headers being sent with our requests. Editing these can be very useful when attempting to see how a webserver will respond to unexpected headers.
- Response Headers show us the headers that the server sent back in response to our request. These cannot be edited (as we can't control what headers the server returns to us). Note that this section will only show up after we have sent the request and received a response.

These components can all be found as text within the request and response sections; however, it can be nice to see them in the tabular format offered by Inspector. It is well worth adding, removing, and editing headers in Inspector to get a feel for how the raw version changes as you do so.

##### Repeater -- best suited practical examples
Repeater is best suited for the kind of task where we need to send the same request numerous times, usually with small changes in between requests. For example, we may wish to manually test for an SQL Injection vulnerability, attempt to bypass a web application firewall filter, or simply add or change parameters in a form submission.
