Malware (malicious software) is one of the central weapons of cyber criminals:
- Any device is a potential target for malware
- Malware can target both: Users and (service) providers
	- home/personal computers
	- smartphones
	- IoT devices
	- servers & websites on the internet
 
 Internet: easy target for cybercriminals
 - billions of entry points to the internet
 - millions of interconnected networks
 - many design and configuration errors in the protocols, systems, and applications
 - large number of vulnerabilities and security loopholes
 
 > Result of a study shows attack sophistication increases while the knowledge required to lauch the attacks decreases.]
 
 Safety was not a primary consideration when the internet protocols were developed.
 
  Absence/lack of:
  - awareness of information security
  - qualified personnel for information security, system and network administration
  - global internet is difficult to regulate
  - lack of power to enforce regulations

##### Most common attacks
**DoS and DDoS attacks**
- Denial-of-Service (DoS) - attack aimed to disrupt the availability of a service on the internet.
- Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) - attack carried out from many different stations in the internet (e.g., executed via botnet).

**Malware (Virus, Worms, Trojans)**
Malware is software that is intentionally designed to cause damage to computers, networks, applications, services,...
- _Virus_ - destructive mini-program carried by the "infected" applications or data.
- _Worm_ - malicious software that automatically spreads over open network connections.
- _Trojan_ - malware unintentionally installed on computer systems by a naive user. Its functionality differs from what the user expects, e.g., installation of a backdoor or record password entries in the background. E.g., "Emotet" is used in recent major attacks to capture financial account details.
- _Spoofing_ - attacker sends messages with a fake sender address, e.g., fake IP address or email address. Is often used in connection with Phishing.
- _Phishing_ - "social engineering" method that asks users to reveal their sensitive information, such as passwords. Attackers use fake emails, websites, phone calls, etc.
- _Defacement_ - attack on a website or web server with the intention of changing its content. Can be used for phishing of user data (users don't realize that the website is an unauthorized fake).
- _Sniffing_ - is a method developed for network diagnostics by "listening" on the complete network traffic. Administrators can use it to detect errors in the network traffic, e.g., using network sniffing software like Wireshark.
- _Eavesdropping_ - refers to unauthorized sniffing ("listening") to data packets on their way through the network. Attacker connects to the victim's network while collecting and analyzing IP packets to capture personal data or other confidential private data. Direct reading of unencrypted data traffic. Encrypted data traffic can be recorded and decrypted later if the encryption is not strong enough. 
- _Social Engineering_ - attacks not only to steal passwords like in the phishing example, but to install malware.

**Malware** (malicious software), is "smuggled" over the internet by hackers and cybercriminals onto the device of an unsuspecting user in order to act in the interests of the cybercriminals.
- _Objectives:_ limitation of the working capacity of the system; destruction or manipulation of data; password theft; espionage and sabotage; blackmail; remote control; etc.

Technical failures are one of the main reasons for malware attacks.
A technical failure is a deviation of the state of a computer system from its expected state.
- software design errors
- software implementation errors
- hardware errors
- administrative errors (lack of knowledge/awareness)

Entire Internet Protocol suite has been designed almost without security mechanisms. Early Internet Standards RFCs explicitly stated that security concerns are not covered.

Although the design of a software might be secure, the implementation can open holes for attacks:
- unchecked inputs
- missing fallback criteria (try, catch)
- missing distinction between user groups (e.g. administrator vs. standard user)
- insecure cryptographic methods
- hardcoded passwords/keys

Hardware errors & failures:
- design errors of components
- insecure reboot sequences (one of the motivation for DoS attacks. To make the system crash. When the system reboots, often if not correctly configured, it restarts with default settings that are known to the attacker). 
- physically accessible devices (wifi router, switches, terminals,...)

Administrative errors/lack of awareness:
- default credentials (username: root, password: root)
- wrong domain settings
- errors in the settings of firewalls/IDS/IPS/SPAM filter/sandbox environments...
- unused standard software on computers
- missing patches and updates
- errors in networking
- working with administrator/root accounts

Security practices in software development
OWASP proposes best security practices for secure software development:
- an application/user should only have as much access to resources as it needs
- avoid security by obscurity (be transparent when implementing security measures)
- keep security measures simple
- Minimize attack surface
