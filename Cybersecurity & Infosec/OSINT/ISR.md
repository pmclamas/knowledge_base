**ISR - Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance**

ISR encompasses multiple activities related to the planning and operation of systems that collect, process, and disseminate data in support of current and future military operations.
ISR is typically used in reference to military applications. ISR is an integrated intelligence and operations function that can be defined as a coordinated acquisition, processing, and provision of accurate, relevant, timely information and intelligence to support a commander's decision making process.
Some examples of information acquired by ISR systems include optical, radar, or infrared images, and electronic signals. The means of acquiring this data include satellites, unmanned aircraft and aircraft systems, specialised ground, sea, or space-based equipment, and human intelligence (HUMINT) teams.
