In the Junior Security Analyst role, you will be a Triage Specialist. You will spend a lot of time triaging or monitoring the event logs and alerts. The responsibilities for a Junior Security Analyst or Tier1 SOC Analyst include:
- Monitor and investigate the alerts (most of the time, it's a 24x7 SOC operations environment).
- Configure and manage the security tools. 
- Develop and implement basic IDS (Intrusion Detection System) signatures.  
- Participate in SOC working groups, meetings. 
- Create tickets and escalate the security incidents to the Tier 2 and Team Lead if needed.  
**Required qualifications (most common)**
- 0-2 years of experience with Security Operations
- Basic understanding of Networking (OSI model, TCP/IP model), Operating systems (Linux, Windows).
- Scripting/programming skills are a plus

**Desired certification**
- CompTIA Security+

#### Security Operations Center (SOC)
The core function of a SOC is to investigate, monitor, prevent, and respond to threats 24/7. 
"Security operations teams are charged with monitoring and protecting many assets, such as intellectual property, personnel data, business systems, and brand integrity. As the implementation component of an organization's overall cybersecurity framework, security operations teams act as the central point of collaboration in coordinated efforts to monitor, assess, and defend against cyberattacks."

**_Preparation and Prevention_**
As a Junior Security Analyst, you should stay informed of the current cybersecurity threats. It's crucial to detect and hunt threats, work on a Security roadmap to protect the organization, and be ready for the worst-case scenario.
Prevention methods include gathering intelligence data on the latest threats, threat actors, and their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). It also includes the maintenance procedures like updating the firewall signatures, patching the vulnerabilities in the existing systems, block-listing and safe-listing applications, email addresses, and IPs.

**_Monitoring and Investigation_**
A SOC team proactively uses SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools to monitor suspicious and malicious network activities. 
Categories classify the seriousness of the threat. As a Security Analyst, you will learn how to prioritize the alerts based on their level: Low, Medium, High, and Critical. Having properly configured security monitoring tools in place will give you the best chance to mitigate the threat.
Junior Security Analysts play a crucial role in the investigation procedure. They perform triaging on the ongoing alerts by exploring and understanding how a certain attack works and preventing bad things from happening. During the investigation, it's important to raise the question "How? When and why?". Security Analysts find the answers by drilling down on the data logs and alerts in combination with using the open-source tools.

**A day in the life of a Junior (Associate) Security Analyst**
To be in the frontline is not always easy and can be very challenging as you will be working with various log sources from different tools. 
You will get a chance to monitor the network traffic, including IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) alerts, suspicious emails, extract the forensics data to analyze and detect the potential attacks, use open-source intelligence (OSINT) to help you make the appropriate decisions on the alerts.

One of the most exciting and rewarding things is when you are finished working on an incident and have managed to remediate the threat. Incident Response might take hours, days, or weeks; it all depends on the scale of the attack: did the attacker manage to exfiltrate the data? How much data does the attacker manage to exfiltrate? Did the attacker attempt to pivot into other hosts? There are many questions to ask and a lot of detection, containment, and remediation to do. 

The first thing almost every Junior (Associate) Security Analyst does on their shift is to look at the tickets to see if any alerts got generated.
