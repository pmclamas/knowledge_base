**What is an SSRF?**

SSRF stands for Server-Side Request Forgery. It’s a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to cause the webserver to make an additional or edited HTTP request to the resource of the attacker’s choosing.

There are two types of SSRF vulnerability. The first is a regular SSRF where data is returned to the attacker’s screen. The second is a Blind SSRF vulnerability where an SSRF occurs, but no information is returned to the attacker’s screen.

A successful SSRF attack can result in any of the following:

-   Access to unauthorised areas.
-   Access to customer/organisational data.
-   Ability to scale to internal networks.
-   Reveal authentication tokens/credentials.

**Finding an SSRF**

Potential SSRF vulnerabilities can be stopped in web applications in many different ways. Here is an example of four common places to look:

Some of these examples are easier to exploit than others, and this is where a lot of trial and error will be required to find a working payload.

If working with a blind SSRF where no output is reflected back to you, you’ll need to use an external HTTP logging tool to monitor requests such as [requestbin.com](http://requestbin.com), your own HTTP server or Burp Suite.

**Defeating Common SSRF Defenses**

More security-savvy developers aware of the risks of SSRF vulnerabilities may implement checks in their applications to make sure the requested resource meets specific rules. There are usually two approaches to this, either a deny list or an allow list.

**Deny List -** is where all requests are accepted apart from resources specified in a list or matching a particular pattern. A Web Application may employ a deny list to protect sensitive endpoints, IP addresses or domains from being accessed by the public while still allowing access to other locations. A specific endpoint to restrict access is the [localhost](http://localhost), which may contain server performance data or further sensitive information, so domain names such as localhost and 127.0.0.1 would appear on a deny list. Attackers can bypass a Deny List using alternative localhost references.

**Allow List -** is where all requests get denied unless they appear on a list or match a particular pattern, such as a rule that an URL used in a parameter must begin with [https://website.thm](https://website.thm). An attacker could quickly circumvent this rule by creating a subdomain on an attacker’s domain name. The application logic would now allow this input and let an attacker control the internal HTTP request.

**Open Redirect**

An open redirect is an endpoint on the server where the website visitor gets automatically redirected to another website address.
