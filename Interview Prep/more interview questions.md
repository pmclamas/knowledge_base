### What is Information Security?
Information Security refers to the processes and tools designed and deployed to protect sensitive business information from modification, disruption, destruction, and inspection.

**What is the difference between cybersecurity and information security?**
Infosec is a crucial part of cybersecurity, but it refers exclusively to the processes designed for data security.
Cybersecurity is a more general term that includes Infosec.

**What is the GDPR?**
In 2016, the European Parliament and Council agreed on the General Data Protection Regulation. In the spring of 2018, the GDPR began requiring companies to:
- provide data breach notifications
- appoint a data-protection officer
- require user consent for data processing
- anonymyze data for privacy
All companies operating within the EU and with the EU must comply with these standards.

**What types of Infosec exist?**
- ***Application security -*** is a broad topic that covers software vulnerabilities in web and mobile applications and application programming interfaces (APIs). These vulnerabilities may be found in authentication or authorization of users, integrity of code and configurations, and mature policies and procedures. Application vulnerabilities can create entry points for significant Infosec breaches.
- ***Cloud security -*** focuses on building and hosting secure applications in cloud environments and securely consuming third-party cloud applications. Businesses must amke sure that there is adequate isolation between different processes in shared environments.
- ***Cryptography -*** encrypting data in transit and data at rest helps ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Digital signatures are commonly used in cryptography to validate the authenticity of data. A good example of cryptography use is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The AES is a symmetric key algorithm used to protect classified information.
- ***Infrastucture security -*** deals with the protection of internal and extranet networks, labs, data centers, servers, desktops, and mobile devices.
- ***Incident response -*** is the function that monitors for and investigates potentially malicious behavior. In preparation for breaches, IT staff should have an incident response plan for containing the threat and restoring the network. In addition, the plan should create a system to preserve evidence for forensic analysis and potential prosecution. This data can help prevent further breaches and help staff discover the attacker.
- ***Vulnerability management -*** is the process of scanning an environment for weak points (such as unpatched software) and prioritizing remediation based on risk. In many networks, businesses are constantly adding applications, users, infrastructure, and so on. For this reason, it is important to constantly scan the network for potential vulnerabilities. Finding a vulnerability in advance can save businesses the catastrophic costs of a breach.
