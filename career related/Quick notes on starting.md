**Soft skills for cybersecurity careers:**

1.  You're a leader - security experts show leadership through their credibility, responsiveness, and ethics. A security expert earns trust from senior management, peers, and subordinates with excellent communication skills. An important skill to have is to undestand the risks of the business, internally and externally. Security leaders provide actionable insights to their leadership and help this team make informed decisions.
2.  You're passionate about learning - security experts are continually learning the latest trends, technologies, and security challenges within the business environment. You have to be passionate about learning and professional growth to be successful. Security is one of the most fast-paced segments in IT and requires someone with an insatiable appetite for knowledge and expertise.
3.  You're determined - cybersecurity consultants have to be persistent with an ever-changing threat landscape but also handle very difficult jobs to start. Persistence is key. A cybersecurity expert sees a solution through to completion and doesn't stop until the challenge is solved.
4.  You're collaborative - cybersecurity is a shared responsibility across the organization. Therefore, cybersecurity consultants are collaborative and work at all levels of the organization to instill a culture of cybersecurity. They make sure security policies are not only in place but followed.
5.  You're analytical, inquisitive and insightful - a skilled cybersecurity consultant is analytical regarding an understanding how incidents occur, the attack surfaces prone to exploitation, and how to minimize cyber attacks. This particular skillset can take years to develop and even includes a little intuition on the part of the consultant.
6.  You can think hyper critically - an analytical and insightful security consultant anticipates how hackers will exploit the network and its applications. In a way, the cybersecurity expert thinks like a hacker or "Black Hat" and identities the vulnerabilities ahead of time.
7.  You're consultative - as a cybersecurity expert, you have to interface with the IT department, the C-level, and end users. It's important that you see the big picture and ask the right questions at all levels of the organization. It' also important that you work with the broader business goals in mind and deploy your security plans with key performance indicators (KPIs) in mind.
8.  You're a project manager - as a cybersecurity leader, you will need to put together comprehensive security solutions to prevent, detect and respond to cyber attacks. Rather than thinking of installing a solution as "one-and-done", you need to think of them more holistically, building a complete "Defense-in-Depth" security strategy that alligns to all the resources of the organization.

Computer Hacking Foresinc Investigator

Computer hacking forensic investigation is the process of detecting hacking attacks and properly extracting evidence to report the crime and conduct audits to prevent future attacks.

Computer forensics field includes several branches related to firewalls, networks, databases, and mobile devices.

Security of information is a matter of prime concern in today's information based economy.

The increasing use of social engineering has increased the risk of attacks on the information data of any company or business.

Digital Artifact - digital artifacts include computer systems, hard drives, cd's, and other storage devices, as well as electronic documents and files like emails and JPEG images.

White Hat Hacking - is focused in the prevention of most common attacks and securing systems and networks. White Hat hacking is designed to ensure a strong understanding of hacking practices including footprinting and reconnaissance, scanning networks, SQL injection, worms and viruses, DoS attacks, social engineering, and honeypots.

Required skills for Cyber Security professionals

-   Foundational Skills:
    -   Risk Management - risk is the driving force behind all security operations. In other words, you do some security task to, one way or another, respond to a risk that your company faces. When you can demonstrate that risk forms the underpinning of all your cyber security efforts, you communicate to employers that you truly understand your own worth to the business, and not as some isolated worker who lives in a vacuum.
    -   Networking basics - the company network forms the backbone of its computing environments, and without adequate knowledge of basic networking principles, your security operations will rarely get off the ground. A skill set that includes both theoretical and practical knowledge of TCP/IP is a must-have.
    -   Situational Awareness - ensures that you can understand your work in the context of time and inevitable changes, rather than remaining stuck in the past. Threats, vulnerabilities, and attackers are constantly evolving.
    -   Toolkit maintenance - whether it's software or hardware, all cyber security pros will need to maintain a toolkit that they use every day. Keeping these tools updated and understanding their limitations are crucial skills.

The CompTIA Security+ certification is the industry standard for validating the essential cyber security skills described above.

-   Security Analyst Skills:
    -   Threat assessment - this skill focused on researching and maintaining awareness of known threats, as well as identification of a threat's characteristics. Where does a threat come from? What vectors does it take? What is it capable of doing?
    -   Vulnerability assessment - organizations must also look inward and identify how exactly they are leaving themselves open to attack. A security analyst conducts vulnerability assessments to pinpoint where in the infrastructure security is at its weakest, and will likewise offer suggestions to fix those vulnerabilities.
    -   Log Collection and Analysis - logs are undoubtedly a primary source of analysis for most assets. Analysts need to be able to separate the signal from the noise when collecting logs. Other than finely tuning your collection process, as an analyst, you also need to be able to manipulate the log data so that the most useful information about an event can quickly and easily be revealed.
    -   Active Analysis - Not all useful data comes from logs. Data can come from a variety of sources. It can also come from certain situtational indicators, like a phishing attempt that follows a certain pattern, suggesting a greater compromise than usual. An analyst who can do more than just review logs will be an asset to any company.
-   Incident Responder Skills:
    -   Communication - A responder often has a responsability beyond other security professionals to routinely inform different stakeholders about an incident in multiple ways. They'll also need to be adept at communicating with other responders, keeping a level head in times of crisis.
    -   Disaster Recovery - for large-scale risks that become a reality, the incident responder will need to be able to ensure the continuity of business operations. This may mean shifting key systems to alternate sites or restoring data from backups quickly and effectively.
    -   Forensics - The incident responder may not be directly responsible for performing a forensic investigation, but they will likely need to anticipate the needs of the investigation. The responder will need to identify and eliminate an issue, while at the same time ensuring that the integrity of digital evidence is preserved. They must understand the key ideas behind digital forensics and apply them to their recovery efforts whenever the situation demands it.
-   Penetration Tester Skills:
    -   Intelligence gathering - technical reconnaissance like port scanning and fingerprinting of systems is a part of the job, but you should also become skilled at mining data from public and open-source intelligence sources.
    -   Persistence - In this case, persistence refers to the post-attack phase where an attacker will try to maintain some covert foothold within the company after the main attack phase has concluded. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are often missed during incident response, and they can have devastating and long-lasting effects. It's a valuable skill for a pen tester to try and persist within the network after conducting the main portion of their simulated attack.
    -   Restraint - Penetration Testers hold a lot of power and responsibility in the company, especially since their goal is to accurately reproduce the attack process. Managers will set a scope to limit the potential damage a pen test can cause, and they expect their professionals to follow that scope.

Showing restraint demonstrates to an employer that you care more about helping the company than exercising power over it.

The GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN) certification is ideal for validating the penetration tester skills described above.

-   Security Architect skills:
    -   Identify and access management - IAM is a huge component of the company's security architecture, as it applies the concepts of authentication and authorization to systems, people, and other assets. A security architect must become familiar with access control methods and user account management principles.
    -   Network configuration - a significant portion of the architect's job is to ensure that the network infrastructure is designed with security at the forefront. To accomplish this, you'll need to develop your skills in networking topics like subnets, VLANs, and other segmentation and isolation tactics. Being able to construct rules for application-layer firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are also skills that employers look for in a prospective security architect.
    -   System Hardening - You'll need to know how to develop baselines to use as a standard for configuring workstations, file servers, databases, web servers, and many other systems.
-   Secure Software Development skills:
    -   Software Development Lifecycle Management - Every software developer must be able to work within an SDLC. SDLCs provide a framework for a development project and guide the project from early design phases to eventual release. For the secure developer, knowing how to integrate security into each phase of an SDLC is a crucial skill to have, as it minimizes the risk a business takes on when it creates its own applications.
    -   Development Testing - testing software is a very involved and often complex process, but it is vital to ensuring the security of a finished product. Developers must conduct a variety of different test types, like input validation, stress testing, and user acceptance testing. You should also gain experience using tools like fuzzers and app vulnerability scanners.

Ethical Hackers

Certified ethical hackers use their knowledge and tools to reveal the weaknesses in the computer system of an organization. They also suggest about the precautionary, remedial and defensive measures after detecting the weaknesses of a system. They are trained to protect all types of networks from unwanted hackers.

Ethical Hacking topics:

Scanning

Testing

hacking and securing their own computer system from attackers

Policy creation

Intrusion detection

DDoS Attacks

Social Engineering

Virus creation

Buffer overflows

Forensic investigators

Are the professionals who work for detecting the attacks of hacker on the computer system of an organization along with extracting the evidences properly to report the crime to the higher authorities. They also help in preventing the hacker attacks in future by auditing the system thoroughly.

The simple meaning of computer forensic is the application of the techniques of computer investigation and analysis to determine potential legal evidences for the safety of the computer system of the organization in future. These evidences can be required to resolve a number of computer related misuse or crimes along with theft or damage of intellectual property, frauds and theft of trade secrets, etc.

With the increase in number of cyber-crimes and other conflicting situations, it has become necessary to analyze the computer systems through a competent investigator to find out and secure the evidences on electronic system.

These evidences become important in various situations including hacking of computer, disloyalty of employees, breach of contract terms, misuse of pornography, email frauds, industrial surveillance, disputed sacking of employees, bankruptcy, theft of company's documents and defacement of web pages, etc.

Learning computer hacking forensic investigator is beneficial for defense and military personnel, police and personnel of other law enforcement agencies, system administrators, security professionals of an e-business, Banking and Insurance professionals, legal professionals, IT Managers and professionals of government agencies, etc. In fact, the basic purpose of ethical hacker and computer hacking forensic investigator is to keep the important data of a business organization or a security agency safe from the malicious hackers. But ethical hackers investigate only the probabilities of hacking a computer system and fix the weakness of the system. The computer hacking forensic investigators, on the other hand, also collect evidences to prosecute the hackers in the court of law along with detecting the reasons of intrusion by the hackers.
