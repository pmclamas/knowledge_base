**What is Penetration Testing?**

A Penetration Test is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protest these assets and pieces of information. A Penetration Test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

**Penetration Testing Ethics**

Recall that a penetration test is an authorised audit of a computer system’s security and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems. The legality of penetration is pretty clear-cut in this sense; anything that falls outside of this agreement is deemed unauthorised.

Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. Various tools, techniques, and systems to be tested are agreed on. This discussion forms the scope of the penetration testing agreement and will determine the course the penetration test takes.

Companies that provide penetration testing services are held against legal frameworks and industry accreditation.

Penetration testers will often be faced with potentially morally questionable decisions during a penetration test. For example, they are gaining access to a database and being presented with potentially sensitive data. Or they are, perhaps, performing a phishing attack on an employee to test an organisation’s human security. If that action has been agreed upon during the initial stages, it is legal - however, ethically questionable.

_Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into._

-   White Hat: they remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.
-   Grey Hat: use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.
-   Black Hat: are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.

**Rules of Engagement (ROE)**

The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections, which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out.

-   Permission - this section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.
-   Test scope - this section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.
-   Rules - the rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM attacks are okay.

**Penetration Testing Methodologies**

Penetration tests can have a wide variety of objectives and targets within scope. Because of this, no penetration test is the same, and there are no one-case fits all as to how a penetration tester should approach it.

The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology. A practical methodology is a smart one, where the steps taken are relevant to the situation at hand. For example, having a methodology that you would use to test the security of a web application is not practical when you have to test the security of a network.

Before discussing some different industry-standard methodologies, we should note that all of them have a general theme of the following stages:

-   Information gathering: this stage involves collecting as much publicly accessible information about a target or organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research. Note: this does not involve scanning any systems.
-   Enumeration/Scanning: this stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.
-   Exploitation: this stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.
-   Privilege Escalation: once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally, is accessing another account of the same permission group, whereas vertically is that of another permission group.
-   Post-exploitation: this stage involves a few sub-stages: 1) what other hosts can be targeted (pivoting); 2) what additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user; 3) covering your tracks; 4) Reporting.

**OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)**

Provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:

1.  Telecommunications
2.  Wired networks
3.  Wireless communications

Advantages: Covers various testing strategies in depth.Includes testing strategies for specific targets (telecommunications and networking).The framework is flexible depending upon the organisation’s needs.The framework is meant to set a standard for systems and applications, meaning that a universal methodology can be used in a penetration testing scenario.

Disadvantages: The framework is difficult to understand, very detailed, and tends to use unique definitions.

**OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)**

Is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.

Advantages: Easy to pick up and understand.Actively maintained and is frequently [updated.It](http://updated.It) covers all stages of an engagement: from testing to reporting and remediation.Specialises in web applications and services.

Disadvantages: - It may not be clear what type of vulnerability a web application has (they can often overlap).

-   OWASP does not make suggestions to any specific software development life cycles.
-   The framework doesn’t hold any accreditation such as CHECK.

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1**

Is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organisations from critical infrastructure all through to commercial.

Advantages: The NIST Framework is estimated to be used by 50% of American organisations by 2020.The framework is extremely detailed in setting standards to help organisations mitigate the threat posed by cyber attacks.The framework is frequently updated.NIST provides accreditation for organisations that use this framework.The NIST framework is designed to be implemented alongside other frameworks.

Disadvantages: - NIST has many iterations of frameworks, so it may be difficult to decide which one applies to your organisation.

-   The NIST Framework has weak auditing policies, making it difficult to determine how a breach occurred.
-   The framework does not consider cloud computing, which is quickly becoming increasingly popular for organisations.

**NCSC CAF (Cyber Assessment Framework)**

Is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation’s defences against these.

The framework applies to organisation’s considered to perform “vitally important services and activities” such as critical infrastructure, banking, etc. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:

-   Data Security
-   System Security
-   Identity and access control
-   Resiliency
-   Monitoring
-   Response and recovery planning

Advantages: This framework is backed by a government cybersecurity agency.This framework provides accreditation.This framework covers fourteen principles which range from security to response.

Disadvantages: • The framework is still new in the industry, meaning that organisations haven’t had much time to make the necessary changes to be suitable for it. • The framework is based on principles and ideas and isn’t as direct as having rules like some other frameworks.

**Black-box, White-box, and Grey-box Penetration Testing**

Black-box = no knowledge

Grey-box = partial knowledge

White-box = full knowledge

There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service. Your understanding of your target will determine the level of testing that you perform in your penetration testing engagement.

**Black-box testing -** this testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.

The tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software. This testing can involve interacting with the interface, i.e. buttons, and testing to see whether the intended result is returned. No knowledge of programming or understanding of the programme is necessary for this type of testing.

Black-box testing significantly increases the amount of time spent during the information gathering and enumeration phase to understand the attack surface of the target.

**Grey-box testing -** this testing process is the most popular for things such as penetration testing. It is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing processes. The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software. Still, it will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.

With Grey-box testing, the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.

**White-box testing -** this testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. The tester will be testing the internal components of the application or piece of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time.

The tester will have full knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour and is much more time consuming than black-box testing. The full knowledge in a White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees the entire attack surface can be validated.
