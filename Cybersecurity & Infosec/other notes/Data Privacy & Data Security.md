Data Privacy and Data Security aren't the same terms.

Data privacy is about proper usage, collection, retention, deletion, and storage of data.

Data security is policies, methods, and means to secure personal data.

**Definition of Data Privacy**

Data Privacy, or Information Privacy, is concerned with proper handling, processing, storage and usage of personal information. It is all about the rights of individuals with respect to their personal information.

_**The most common concerns regarding data privacy are:**_

-   Managing contracts or policies;
-   Applying governing regulation or law (like GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation)
-   Third-party management.

Privacy, in general, is an individual's right to freedom from intrusion and prying eyes or the right of the person to be left alone.

It is guaranteed under the constitution in many developed countries, which makes it a fundamental human right and one of the core principles of human dignity.

Any risk assessment conducted for the purpose of enhancing the privacy of individuals' personal data is performed from the perspective of protecting the rights and freedoms of those individuals.

**Definition of Data Security**

Data Security is focused on protecting personal data from any unauthorized third-party access or malicious attacks and exploitation of data. It is set up to protect personal data using different methods and techniques to ensure data privacy.

Data Security ensures the integrity of the data, meaning data is accurate, reliable and available to authorized parties.

_**Data Security methods practices and processes can include:**_

-   Activity monitoring
-   Network security
-   access control
-   breach response
-   encryption
-   multi-factor authentification

**Cybersecurity**

When it comes to cybersecurity, we can agree that it refers to protective measures that we put in place to protect our digital assets from harmful events such as human and technical errors, malicious individuals and unauthorized users.

However, for the sake of completeness, we have to admit that even in this day and age, not all information is digital. We still deal with numerous paper documents, which in turn hold very valuable information worth protecting.

This is exactly where the term Information Security (Infosec) comes in handy, denoting the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information in whatever form.

_**The three pillars upon which Information Security is built are:**_

-   _**Confidentiality -**_ prevents sensitive information from reaching wrong people, while making sure that the right people can use it;
-   _**Integrity -**_ maintains the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of information over its lifecycle;
-   _**Availability -**_ ensures that the information is available when it is needed.

These are very often referred to as the C-I-A triad, and they all have to be addressed in order to achieve a satisfactory level of information security.

Like many things in life where nothing is perfect, the same goes for security; there is no such thing as a 100% secure system. There are only acceptable levels of risk.

This means that in order to secure information, an organization must first conduct a formal risk assessment. This risk assessment will then be cross-referenced with the organization's risk acceptance criteria and consequently, a risk treatment plan can be developed.

Only then, security controls will be chosen with the aim to mitigate specific residual risks. In information security, this is known as a risk-based approach to security.

**What about data protection?**

Data Protection is essentially amalgamated security and privacy.

With each of the two dealing with their own set of challenges, when combined it delivers protected usable data as the result.
