"Words enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-machine communication. As machines become more central do daily life, that communication becomes ever more important. Traditional software engineering - write programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences of steps to execute - has been the main path to code literacy. But AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data."

"Uses of AI and Data Science can be found in almost any situation that produces data, and I believe that a wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived insights than for traditional software engineering. **This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding even more valuable than traditional skills.** It could enable countless individuals to harness data to make their lives richer."

Things I'd prioritise learning if I was to study to become a Machine Learning engineer: 
	version control; sql + nosql; python; pandas/dask; data structures; rest api; probabilities & statistics; ML algorithms; parallel computing; kubernetes + airflow; unit/integration tests.

"You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data."

"I'm fascinated by Machine Learning models and the incredible tools they offer our world, whether for making decisions, predicting trends, improving lives and even saving them. Those models are trained and tested on tremendous amounts of data that is constantly being collected and stored in databases.
I was really curious to learn how raw data gets into programs and what processes are being done to make this raw data useful, even before training a brilliant Machine Learning model."

"It will take years for us to fully harness the technology that is available today. Right now, a tiny percentage of companies are currently using AI/ML at scale. As it becomes more accessible, the coming years will see an explosion in demand."

**"Don't think of AI as a 'human replacement' solution. In fact, most of AI's powers today come from its capacity as a 'human enhancer'. Technology that augments humans. Technology that helps us do our jobs way more effectively and efficiently."**

"Don't start your career in Machine Learning by writing a lot of code. You should start by learning to think about problems. Let tools worry about implementations. Focus your energy on doing the thinking." - Santiago, @svpino

Useful courses in a transition to Machine Learning:
- Linear Algebra
- Computational Mathematics
- Differential calculus
- Information theory
- Complex numbers and vectors
- Algorithms
- Probability
- Statistics
- Data Mining

**What does it mean to be data-driven?**
When a company employs a "data-driven" approach, it means it makes strategic decisions based on data analysis and interpretation.
A data-driven approach enables companies to examine and organise their data with the goal of better serving their customers and consumers.

**Data Governance -** is the overall availability, usability, integrity, and security of your organisation's data.

**Granularity -** the amount of detail in your data. Data granularity implies data storage costs.

#### Data Analysis
**Explanatory analysis -** translating insights into visualisations (excel, tableau, PowerBI)
**Exploratory analysis -** mining data for interesting insights

**Types of Analysis**
- ***Descriptive -*** using historical trends to uncover insights
- ***Predictive -*** using historical trends to forecast future trends
- ***Prescriptive -*** building optimisation models for decision-making

**Note:** most businesses are not in a position to consider optimisation or predictive modeling.
Descriptive analytics is the most common.

**Data Visualisation**
Is the presentation of quantitative information in a graphical form.
An effective data visualisation turns huge amounts of information into a visual format that tells a narrative.

*Creating powerful visualisations:*
- keep it simple
- use color sparingly
- stay focused on one problem or area of business at a time

**Data modeling**
**Data model** is a blueprint of how all your data is related.

**Dashboards**
1. you need to focus on the business problem that you're trying to resolve
2. Display the KPIs that track success for this specific problem
3. Think through the dimensions that can help you uncover insights.
