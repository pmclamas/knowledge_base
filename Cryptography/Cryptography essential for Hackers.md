**What is Cryptography?**
Is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties. It is a process of converting data into unreadable format to protect data from unauthorized people.

**Why is it important?**
To protect our data from malicious user or unintended person, and also to maintain confidentiality of CIA trade.

**Basic terms:**
- _Cipher:_ an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption.
- _Plaintext:_ the unencrypted or "original" message.
- _Ciphertext:_ the encrypted message.
- _Key:_ a piece of information that specifies the transformation of plaintext into ciphertext, and vice versa, for decryption algorithms.

**Encoding -** is the process of storing data. It is just like translation of data. Different computer systems operate with different forms of encoding. 
Same data can be encoded into various forms.
**_Base:_** the total number of unique elements we can use to represent data in an encoding format.

**_Some common encoding format:_** ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange); Base 2 (Binary); Base16 (Hex); Base32; Base64.
