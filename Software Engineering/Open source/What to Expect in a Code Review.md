When you submit a pull request, you are in dialogue with a larger project.

Submitting a pull request is invisting others to talk about your work. For you to have a successful conversation, it is important for you to be able to communicate 'why' you are making the pull request thorugh your commit messages, so it is best to be as precise and clear as possible.

The Pull Request will keep a log of notes from reviewers and any updates and discussion you have together. You may need to make several extra commits throughout this process before the Pull Request is accepted. This is completely normal and provides a good opportunity for you to work on revision as part of a team.

Your pull request will continue to be maintained through Git, and be auto-updated throughout the process as long as you keep adding commits to the same branch and pushing those to your fork.

Though you are putting your code out there into the larger world for review by your peers, you should never be made to feel like the review is getting personal, so be sure to read relevant [CONTRIBUTION.md](http://contribution.md) files or Codes of Conduct. It is important to make sure that your commits are aligning with the guidelines specified by the project, but if you begin to feel uncomfortable, the project you are working on may not be deserving of your contribution. There are many welcoming spaces in the open-source community and while you can expect your code to be looked at with a critical eye, all feedback you receive should be professional and courteous.
