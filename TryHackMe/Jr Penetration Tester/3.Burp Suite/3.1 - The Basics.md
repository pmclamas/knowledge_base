#### What is Burp suite?
Burp Suite is a framework that aims to provide a one-stop-shop for web application penetration testing. Burp Suite is also very commonly used when assessing mobile applications, as the same features which make it so attractive for web app testing translate almost perfectly into testing the APIs powering most mobile apps.

At the simplest level, Burp can capture and manipulate all of the traffic between an attacker and a webserver: this is the core of the framework. After capturing requests, we can choose to send them to various other parts of the Burp Suite framework. This ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests prior to them being sent to the target server (or, in some cases, the responses before they are received by our browser), makes Burp Suite perfect for any kind of manual web app testing.

#### Features of Burp Community
- **Proxy -** allows us to intercept and modify requests/responses when interacting with web applications.
- **Repeater -** allows us to capture, modify, then resend the same request numerous times. This feature can be absolutely invaluable, especially when we need to craft a payload through trial and error or when testing the functionality of an endpoint for flaws.
- **Intruder -** allows us to spray an endpoint with requests. This is often used for bruteforce attacks or to fuzz endpoints.
- **Decoder -** provides a valuable service when transforming data - either in terms of decoding captured information, or encoding a payload prior to sending it to the target. Whilst there are other services available to do the same job, doing this directly within Burp Suite can be very efficient.
- **Comparer -** allows us to compare two pieces of data at either word or byte level.
- **Sequencer -** we usually use Sequencer when assessing the randomness of tokens such as session cookie values or other supposedly random generated data. If the algorithm is not generating secure random values, then this could open up some devastating avenues for attack.

#### The Dashboard
The Dashboard interface is split into four quadrants:

1. The Tasks menu allows us to define background tasks that Burp Suite will run whilst we use the application. The default "Live Passive Crawl" (which automatically logs the pages we visit) will be more than suitable for our uses.
2. The Event log tells us what Burp Suite is doing, as well as information about any connections that we are making through Burp.
3. The Issue Activity section is exclusive to Burp Pro. It won't give us anything using Burp Community, but in Burp Professional it would list all of the vulnerabilities found by the automated scanner. These would be ranked by severity and filterable by how sure Burp is that the component is vulnerable.
4. The Advisory section gives more information about the vulnerabilities found, as well as references and suggested remediations. These could then be exported into a report.

#### Navigation
Navigating around the Burp Suite GUI by default is done entirely using the top menu bars. These allow you to switch between modules.

Keyboard shortcuts:
- Ctrl + shift + D = switch to the dashboard
- Ctrl + shift + T = switch to the target tab
- Ctrl + shift + P = switch to the proxy tab
- Ctrl + shift + I = switch to the Intruder tab
- Ctrl + shift + R = switch to the Repeater tab

#### Options
- Global settings can be found in the User options tab along the top menu bar.
- Project-specific settings can be found in the Project options tab.

The options provided in the User options tab will apply every time we open Burp Suite. In contrast, the Project options will only apply to the current project. Given that we can't save projects in Burp Community, this means that our project options will reset every time we close Burp.

**User options tab**
The settings here apply globally. There are four main sub-sections of the User options tab:
- the options in the _Connections_ sub-tab allow us to control how Burp makes connections to targets. For example, we can set a proxy for Burp Suite to connect through; this is very useful if we want to use Burp Suite through a network pivot.
- The _TLS_ sub-tab allows us to enable and disable various TLS (Transport Layer Security) options, as well as giving us a place to upload client certificates should a web app require us to use one for connections.
- An essential set of options: _Display_ allows us to change how Burp Suite looks. The options here include thing like changing the font and scale, as well as setting the theme for the framework and configuring various options to do with the rendering engine in Repeater.
- The _Misc_ sub-tab contains a wide variety of settings, including the keybinding table (HotKeys), which allowing us to view and alter the keyboard shortcuts used by Burp Suite. (Familiarising yourself with these settings would be advisable, as using the keybinds can speed up your workflow massively).
