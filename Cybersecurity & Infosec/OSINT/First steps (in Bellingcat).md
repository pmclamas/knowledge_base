The promise of Open Source research is that anyone - not just journalists or researchers at select institutions - can contribute to investigations that uncover wrongdoing and hold perpetrators of crimes and atrocities to account.

If you have an internet connection, free time, and a stubborn commitment to getting the facts right, then you too, can be an open source researcher.

Getting started in open source research can be daunting, especially if the field is completely new to you. 

1. **Take stock of your skills and interests**
	Are you interested in a particular conflict? Or do you love solving puzzles, which could translate to geolocating images? Do you have a programming background, or knowledge of several languages? Or are you fascinated by military machinery and equipment?
	Having an idea of what topics interest you and what you're good at will help you find other researchers on social media whose work you might want to follow, and may eventually use to inform for your own.
	If you're not sure how your skills and interests might translate to this field, then don't worry: that just means that you'll have more to discover.

2. **Get on Twitter**
	The importance of this step cannot be overstated. 
	Twitter is the primary medium for identifying, debating, and disseminating open source research. It's full of practitioners who are eager to engage in discussions with others about best methods and practices, and to share their own work and that of others. Having a Twitter account will allow you to follow researchers so that you can learn from their work, as well as ask questions and engage in discussions with like-minded researchers.

3. **Find your people (and put them on a list)**
	Once you're on Twitter, you'll want to follow lots of open source researchers. This will allow you to see what topics the field is interested in, which organisations tend to focus on which issues, and which methods they employ in their research. More importantly, you'll be able to learn directly from the experts about methods, tools, and best practices.
	It might be a good idea to cast a wide net and follow researchers at established institutions like the New York Times Visual Investigations, Bellingcat, or the Washington Post Visual Forensics.

**OOSI, OSINT or OSI?**
Some people use the term "Online Open Source Investigations" (OOSI), while others use "Open Source Investigations" (OSI), but the term that's been around the longest and is used most often on social media is "Open Source Intelligence" (OSINT). These terms are usually used interchangeably, but there are some differences among them that you might want to consider.
The difference between OOSI and OSI is in the name: while OOSI refers to investigations that only use online sources, you would use OSI to describe an investigation that also used offline open sources.
Some who use OOSI or OSI instead of OSINT do so because they feel that the name "OSINT" has direct connotations to intelligence agencies. For these agencies, OSINT is part of an ecosystem of intelligence sources that includes HUMINT (Human Intelligence), SOCMINT (Social Media Intelligence), IMINT (Imagery Intelligence), and others. While some independent researchers might be justifiably uncomfortable with that connotation, the term is still widely used and is probably the most recognised.
In any case, use all of these search terms in order to broaden the resources at your disposal.

**Observe, learn, and practice**
You can start to dedicate time to developing and practicing the new skills you'll be picking up.
One excellent way to practice research skills is by trying out @Quiztime challenges on Twitter. This account posts daily images and challenges you to find out exactly where they were taken.
Sometimes the quizzes also build off an established geolocation for the image, asking you to determine what an object in the image is or when it was taken.

With the example above in mind, how could you narrow down the number of search areas, from "anywhere on the planet" to a particular country or region? How might you determine what kind of bridge that was? Would a reverse image search work, or would you have to dig deeper into bridge design? Are there any bridge architecture databases or other resources that you could draw from? Google Maps would be the starting place for the geolocation, but many places in the world don't have Google Street View. If that's the case for the place where this bridge is located, how else might you find street-level imagery of this place?
These are just some of the questions that you might ask yourself if you were working to solve this challenge, and they're the same kinds of questions that you might ask yourself if you were working on an open source project to verify images of atrocities in a conflict zone.

Geoguessr is a geolocation game that is popular in the open source community. The game drops you into a Google Streetview image, and it's your job to guess exactly where the picture was taken. After each guess, you're given points. The closer your guess is to the actual spot, the more points you get.
You can play by different sets of rules, including no Googling for information or not moving from the spot where you land. These make the game well worth replaying and allow you to tweak its difficulty to your liking.

You might also consider joining events like Trace Lab's Search Party CTF, where four-person teams compete to find information about missing persons. By participating in these events you'd not only be potentially helping find a missing person, but you'd also have the chance to work and learn from other OSI enthusiasts by putting your skills to practice in a team setting.
