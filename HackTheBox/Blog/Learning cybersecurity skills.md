**_"One of the hardest parts about going out for a run is getting out the front door."_**

**Create Measurable goals**
An important part of learning anything new is creating goals and establishing the "what", "why" and "how".
- What do you want to accomplish?
- Why do you want to accomplish that?
- How will you accomplish that?

This approach to developing goals can help you accomplish many things including, but not limited to, passing certification exams and getting jobs.

Dream big with your goals but try to make them measurable.

**But why?**
Your "why" can be deeply personal to you and may be in line with your personal values. Go back to your "why" to keep pushing forward. 
What's your "why"?

**Seek a detailed understanding**
Try seeking a deeper understanding while reading rather than reading just for the sake of completion. This is where goals and your "why" can help. A powerful "why" can encourage you to take your time to truly understand a topic no matter how long it takes.
