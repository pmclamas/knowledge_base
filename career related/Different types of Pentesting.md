Penetration Testing attempts to exploit weaknesses or vulnerabilities in systems, networks, human resources, or physical assets in order to stress test the effectiveness of security controls.
The different types of penetration tests include network services, applications, client side, wireless, social engineering, and physical. A penetration test may be performed externally or internally to simulate different attack vectors. Depending on the goals of each test, a penetration tester may or may not have prior knowledge of the environment and systems they're attempting to breach. This is categorised as black box, white box, and gray box penetration testing.

**What is a Penetration Test?**
A penetration test involves a team of security professionals who actively attempt to break into your company's network by exploiting weaknesses and vulnerabilities in your systems.
Penetration tests may include any of the following methods:
- using social engineering techniques to access systems and related databases.
- sending of phishing emails to access critical accounts.
- using unencrypted passwords shared in the network to access sensitive databases.
These attempts can be far more intrusive than a vulnerability scan and may cause a denial of service or increased system utilization, which may reduce productivity, and corrupt the machines.
In some cases, you may schedule penetration tests and inform staff in advance of the exercise. However, this wouldn't be applicable if you want to test how your internal security team responds to a "live" threat.
For example, Ted Team exercises are often performed without informing staff to test real-world threat scenarios.
In this case, it's important to inform the Blue Team lead, CIO, or upper-level management of the exercise. This ensures the response scenario is still tested, but with tighter control when/if the situation is escalated.
Regardless of the scenario you should conduct a penetration test with a specific intent and clearly define your wants and needs with the penetration testing team.

**What is the primary purpose of Penetration Testing?**
Penetration Testing has become a widely adopted security practice by organisations in recent years.
This is especially true for industries, such as banks or healthcare providers, that store and access sensitive or private information.
While the primary purpose is to expose vulnerabilities or exploit weaknesses, it’s important to note that the main goal of a pentest is often tied to a business objective with an overarching strategy.

On the other hand, a software company’s security goals may vary greatly. For example, application penetration testing helps to identify flaws and weaknesses within code that could be susceptible to an attack. Developers then work to create fixes to update the codebase.

Ultimately, the business goals determine the types of penetration testing performed.

**Reporting on findings**
Upon completion of the testing phase, a report is created and presented to executive leadership and business owners. This is the real value of any penetration testing engagement.

This report should provide direction and guidance for reducing exposure to risk while also providing actionable steps towards a resolution.

It’s important to mention that penetration testing reports are customize tailored to meet a company’s cyber security needs based on:
-   how their network is set up.
-   business objectives for perfoming a pentest.
-   what is being tested - software, servers, endpoints, physical controls, etc.
-   the value of tangible or intangible assets being secured.
-   etc

**What are the different approaches to Penetration Testing?**
Penetration Tests differ both in their approach and in the weaknesses they attempt to exploit. The level of information provided to the pentester will determine their approach as well as the scope of the project.

The different approaches to Penetration Testing include:

-   _**Black Box Penetration Testing -**_ during a black box penetration testing (also known as external penetration testing) the pentester is given little to no information regarding the IT infrastructure of a business.
    
    The main benefit of this method of testing is to simulate a real-world cyber attack, whereby the pentester assumes the role of an uninformed attacker.
    
    A black box penetration test can take up to six weeks to complete making it one of the longest types of penetration tests. This, of course, all depends on the scope of the project.
    
    One of the easiest ways for pentesters to break into a system during a black box test is bt deploying a series of exploits known to work, such as Kerberoasting.
    
    This method of testing is also referred to as the “trial and error” approach, however, there is a high degree of technical skill involved in this process.
    
-   _**White Box Penetration Testing -**_ (also called internal penetration testing) is when the pentester has full knowledge and access to the source code and environment.
    
    The goal of a white box penetration test is to conduct an in-depth security audit of a business’s systems and to provide the pentester with as much detail as possible.
    
    As a result, the tests are more thorough because the pentester has access to areas where a black box test cannot, such as quality of code and application design.
    
    White Box tests do have their disadvantages. For instance, given the level of access the pentester has it can take longer to decide what areas to focus on. In addition, this method of testing often requires sophisticated and expensive tools such as code analyzers and debuggers.
    
-   _**Gray Box Penetration Testing -**_ during a gray box penetration test, the pentester has partial knowledge or access to an internal network or web application.
    
    A pentester may begin with user privileges on a host and be told to escalate their privileges to a domain admin. Or they could be asked to get access to software code and system architecture diagrams.
    
    One main advantage of a gray box penetration test is that the reporting provides a more focused and efficient assessment of your network’s security. For instance, instead of spending time with the “trial and error” approach, pentesters performing a gray box penetration test are able to review the network diagrams to identify areas of greatest risk. From there, the proper countermeasures can be recommended to fill the gaps.
    

**Types of Penetration Testing**

-   _**Network services**_
-   _**web application**_
-   _**client side**_
-   _**wireless**_
-   _**social engineering**_
-   _**physical penetration testing**_

Each type of penetration test requires specific knowledge, methodologies, and tools to perfom and should align with a specific business goal.

These goals could range from improving awareness of social engineering attacks to employees company-wide, to implementing secure code development to identify flaws in software code in real-time, or meeting regulatory or compliance obligations.

_**Network Service Penetration Testing -**_ (or infrastructure testing), is one of the most common types of penetration testing performed. The main purpose is to identify the most exposed vulnerabilities and security weaknesses in the network infrastructure (servers, firewalls, switches, routers, printers, workstations, and more) of an organization before they can be exploited.

Network penetration tests should be performed to protect your business from common network-based attacks including:

-   firewall misconfiguration and firewall bypass
-   IPS/IDS evasion attacks
-   router attacks
-   DNS level attacks
    -   Zone transfer attacks
    -   switching or routing based attacks
-   SSH attacks
-   proxy server attacks
-   unnecessary open ports attacks
-   database attacks
-   Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks
-   FTP/SMTP based attacks

_**Web application penetration testing -**_ is used to discover vulnerabilities or security weaknesses in web-based applications. It uses different penetration techniques and attacks with aims to break into the web application itself.

The typical scope for a web application penetration test includes web based applications, browsers, and their components such as ActiveX, Plugins, Silverlight, Scriptlets, and Applets.

These types of tests are far more detailed and targeted and therefore are considered to be a more complex test. In order to complete a successful test, the endpoints of every web-based application that interacts with the user on a regular basis must be identified.

The techniques of web application penetration testing are continuously evolving with time due to the increase in threats coming from web applications day by day.

A Key reason to perform a web application penetration test is to identify security weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the web based applications and its components like Database, Source code, and the backend network.

In software application development it’s considered best practice to continuously improve the codebase. Deploying a secure and agile code is the phrase often used to describe this practice. Agile code deployment is the preferred method over large batch deployments, as the more variables introduced into the code in a single deployment, the more opportunities there are to create bugs or errors leading to security vulnerabilities.

Agile methodologies use a sandbox environment (a duplicate copy of the codebase) to test code functionality and usability prior to launching into production. If the deployment is unsuccessful, developers can easily single out the change and roll the code back to previous version history.

_**Client side penetration testing -**_ is used to discover vulnerabilities or security weaknesses in client side applications.

Client-side tests are performed to identify specific cyber attacks including:

-   cross-site scripting attacks
-   clickjacking attacks
-   cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
-   form hijacking
-   html injection
-   open redirection
-   malware infection

Wireless penetration testing - involves identifying and examining the connections between all devices connected to the business’s wifi. These devices include laptops, tablets, smartphones, and any other internet of things (IoT) devices.

Wireless penetration tests are typically performed onsite as the pentester needs to be in range of the wireless signal to access it. Alternatively, a NUC an WiFi Pineapple can be deployed onsite to remotely perform the test.

Wireless communications are an invisibly running service that allows data to flow in and out of the network. Therefore, this wireless network must be secured from any weaknesses like unauthorized access or data leakage.

Before performing a wireless penetration test you should consider:

-   have all access points been identified and how many use poor encryption methods?
-   is the data flowing in and out of the network encrypted and if so, how?
-   are there monitoring systems in place to identify unauthorized users?
-   is there any possibility the IT team could have misconfigured or duplicated a wireless network?
-   what are the current measures in place to protect the wireless network?
-   are ll wireless access points using WPA protocol?

**Social Engineering penetration testing -** is where a malicious actor attempts to persuade or trick users into giving them sensitive information, such as a username and password.

Common types of social engineering attacks used: phishing attacks; vishing; smishing; tailgating; imposters; name dropping; pre-texting; dumpster diving; eavesdropping; gifts.

Users are one of the biggest threats to a networks security.

Social engineering tests and awareness programs have proven to be one of the most effective methods of mitigating an attack.

_**Physical penetration testing -**_ simulates a real-world threat whereby a pentester attempts to compromise physical barriers to access a business’s infrastructure, building, systems, or employees.

Physical barriers are often an afterthought for most businesses, however, if a malicious actor is able to gain physical access to your server room then they could own your network.

The primary benefit of a physical penetration test is to expose weaknesses and vulnerabilities in physical controls (locks, barriers, cameras, or sensors) so that flaws can be quickly addressed. Through identifying these weaknesses proper mitigations can be put in place to strengthen the physical security posture.
