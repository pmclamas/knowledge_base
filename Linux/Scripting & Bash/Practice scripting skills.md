(especially with Linux)

In order to be fully effective in cybersecurity, understanding how to code and systematically look through logs is essential.
Get comfortable with the terminal, working on Python and shell scripts, and other programming skills.
You'll want to think about deploying realtime algorithms that are able to sift through data accurately and reliably.

**You'll want to be strong with Linux commands to do the following:**
- view critical system information and status
- be able to detect running processes and programs and start/stop them
- install software and be able to update it securely
- connect into remote systems using tools such SSH
- go through event logs and be able to systematically understand what is happening to a system.
- set up event logs in such a way that you can be efficient at responding to threats.
- view how the network is set up and make changes as needed, and make system changes as needed also.

Knowledge of regular expressions, a way of finding patterns within large blocks of code, will quickly help you go through logs to find out what is happening. And BASH scripts are useful for interacting with the terminal in a more systematic way.
