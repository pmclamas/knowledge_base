Threat Intelligence is data that is collected, processed, and analysed to understand a threat actor's motives, targets, and attack behaviours.
Threat Intelligence enables us to make faster, more informed, data-backed security decisions and change their behaviour from reactive to proactive in the fight against threat actors.

Threat Intelligence is evidence-based knowledge (e.g., context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and action-oriented advice) about existing or emerging menaces or hazards to assets.

###### Why is Threat Intelligence important?
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and defenders are constantly trying to outmanoeuvre each other. Data on a threat actor's next move is crucial to proactively tailoring your defences and preempt future attacks.

However, there is a difference between recognising value and receiving value. Most organisations today are focusing their efforts on only the most basic use cases, such as integrating threat data feeds with existing network, IPS, firewalls, and SIEMs - without taking full advantage of the insights that intelligence can offer.

**Threat Intelligence is important for the following reasons:**
- sheds light on the unknown, enabling security teams to make better decisions.
- empowers cybersecurity stakeholders by revealing adversarial motives and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- helps security professionals better understand the threat actor's decision-making process.
- empowers business stakeholders (executive boards, CISOs, CIOs and CTOs), to invest wisely, mitigate risk, become more efficient and make faster decisions.

Threat Intelligence benefits organisations by helping process threat data to better understand their attackers, respond faster to incidents, and proactively get ahead of a threat actor's next move.

Enterprises with large security teams can reduce the cost and required skills by leveraging external threat intel and make their analysts more effective.

**Threat Intelligence offers unique advantages to every member of a security team:**
- Sec/IT Analyst - optimise prevention and detection capabilities and strengthen defences
- SOC - prioritise incidents based on risk and impact to the organisation
- CSIRT - accelerate incident investigations, management, and prioritisation
- Intel Analyst - uncover and track threat actors targeting the organisation
- Executive management - understand the risks the organisation faces and what the options are to address their impact

##### Threat Intelligence lifecycle
Is a process to transform raw data into finished intelligence for decision making and action. 
Provides a framework to enable teams to optimise their resources and effectively respond to the modern threat landscape.

**The cycle consists of six steps resulting in a feedback loop to encourage continuous improvement:**
1. ***Requirements -*** sets the roadmap for a specific threat intelligence operation. During this planning stage, the team will agree on the goals and methodology of their intelligence program based on the needs. The team may set out to discover: who the attackers are and their motivations, what is the attack surface, what specific actions should be taken to strengthen their defences against a future attack.
2. ***Collection -*** once requirements are defined, the team sets out to collect the information required to satisfy those objectives. Depending on the goals, the team will usually seek out traffic logs, publicly available data sources, social media, etc.
3. ***Processing -*** collected data have to be processed into a format suitable for analysis. Most of the time, this entails organising data points into spreadsheets, decrypting files, translating information from foreign sources, and evaluating the data for relevance and reliability. 
4. ***Analysis -*** once the dataset has been processed, the team must then conduct a thorough analysis to find answers to the questions posed in the requirements phase. The team also works to decipher the dataset into action items and valuable recommendations.
5. ***Dissemination -*** requires the threat intelligence team to translate their analysis into a digestible format and present the results. In most cases the recommendations should be presented concisely, without confusing technical jargon, either in a one-page report or a short slide deck.
6. Feedback - the final stage involves getting feedback on the provided report to determine whether adjustments need to be made for future threat intelligence operations.
