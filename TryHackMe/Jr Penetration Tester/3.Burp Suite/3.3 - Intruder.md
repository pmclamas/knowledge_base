**What is Intruder?**
Intruder allows us to take a request (usually captured in the Proxy before being passed into Intruder) and use it as a template to send many more requests with slightly altered values automatically. For example, by capturing a request containing a login attempt, we could then configure Intruder to swap out the username and password fields for values from a wordlist, effectively allowing us to bruteforce the login form. Similarly, we could pass in a fuzzing wordlist and use Intruder to fuzz for subdirectories, endpoints, or virtual hosts. This functionality is very similar to that provided by command-line tools such as Wfuzz or Ffuf.

In short, as a method for automating requests, Intruder is extremely poweful -- there is just one problem: to access the full speed of Intruder, we need Burp Professional. We can still use Intruder with Burp Community, but it is heavily rate-limited. This speed restriction means that many hackers choose to use other tools for fuzzing and bruteforcing.

Let's take a look at the Intruder interface:
The first view we get is a relatively sparse interface that allows us to choose our target. Assuming that we sent a request in from the Proxy (by using 'CTRL + I' or right-clicking and selecting "Send to Intruder"), this should already be populated for us.

There are four other Intruder sub-tabs:
- Positions allows us to select an Attack Type, as well as configure where in the request template we wish to insert our payloads. 
- Payloads allows us to select values to insert into each of the positions we defined in the previous sub-tab. For example, we may choose to laod items in from a wordlist to serve as payloads. How these get inserted into the template depends on the attack type we chose in the Positions tab. There are many payload types to choose from (anything from a simple wordlist to regexes based on responses from the server). The Payloads sub-tab also allows us to alter Intruder's behaviour with regards to payloads; for example, we can define pre-processing rules to apply to each payload (e.g. add a prefix or suffix, match and replace, or skip if the payload matches a defined regex).
- Resource Pool is not particularly useful to us in Burp Community. It allows us to divide our resources between tasks. Burp Pro would allow us to run various types of automated tasks in the background, which is where we may wish to manually allocate our available memory and processing power between these automated tasks and Intruder. Without access to these automated tasks, there is little point in using this.
- As with most of the other Burp tools, Intruder  allows us to configure attack behaviour in the Options sub-tab. The settings here apply primarly to how Burp handles results and how Burp handles the attack itself. For example, we can choose to flag requests that contain specified pieces of text or define how Burp responds to redirect (3xx) responses.

**Intruder - Positions**
When we are looking to perform an attack with Intruder, the first thing we need to do is look at positions. Positions tell Intruder where to insert payloads.

Let's switch over to the Positions sub-tab:

Burp will attempt to determine the most likely places we may wish to insert a payload automatically -- these are surrounded by silcrows (ยง).

On the right-hand side of the interface, we have the buttons labelled "Add ยง", "Clear ยง", and "Auto ยง".
- Add lets us define new positions by highlighting them in the editor and clicking the button.
- Clear removes all defined positions, leaving us with a blank canvas to define our own.
- Auto attempts to select the most likely positions automatically; this is useful if we cleared the default positions and want them back.

**Attack Types - Introduction**
Let's switch to the "Positions" sub-tab and look in the "Attack types" drop-down menu.
There are four attack types available:
- Sniper
	Sniper is the first and most common attack type.
	When conducting a sniper attack, we provide one set of payloads. For example, this could be a single file containing a wordlist or a range of numbers ("Payload Set"). Intruder will take each payload in a payload set and put it into each defined position in turn.

	We can calculate the number of requests that Intruder Sniper will make as: requests = numberOfWords * numberOfPositions.

	This quality makes Sniper very good for single-position attacks (e.g. a password bruteforce if we know the username or fuzzing for API endpoints).
	
- Battering ram
	Like Sniper, Battering ram takes one set of payloads (e.g. one wordlist). Unlike Sniper, the Battering ram puts the same payload in every position rather than in each position in turn.
	Each item in our list of payloads gets put into every position for each request. True to the name, Battering ram just throws payloads at the target to see what sticks.

- Pitchfork
	After Sniper, Pitchfork is the attack type you are most likely to use. It may help to think of Pitchfork as being like having numerous Snipers running simultaneously. Where Sniper uses one payload set (which it uses on every position simultaneously), Pitchfork uses one payload set per position (up to a maximum of 20) and iterate through them all at once.

	Pitchfork takes the first item from each list and puts them into the request, one per position. It then repeats this for the next request: taking the second item from each list and substituting it into the template. Intruder will keep doing this until one (or all) of the lists run out. Ideally, our payload sets should be identical lengths when working in Pitchfork, as Intruder will stop testing as soon as one of the lists is complete. For example, if we have two lists, one with 100 lines and one with 90 lines, Intruder will only make 90 requests, and the final ten items in the first list will not get tested.

	This attack type is exceptionally useful when forming things like credential stuffing attacks.

- Cluster bomb
	Like Pitchfork, Cluster bomb allows us to choose multiple payload sets: one per position, up to a maximum of 20; however, whilst Pitchfork iterates through each payload set simultaneously, Cluster Bomb iterates through each payload set individually, making sure that every possible combination of payloads is tested.

	Cluster Bomb will iterate through every combination of the provided payload sets to ensure that every possibility has been tested. This attack-type can create a huge amount of traffic (equal to the number of lines in each payload set multiplied together), so be careful! Equally, when using Burp Community and its Intruder rate-limiting, be aware that a Cluster Bomb attack with any moderately sized payload set will take an incredibly long time.

**Intruder: Payloads**
Switch over to the "Payloads" sub-tab; this is split into four sections:
- The Payload Sets section allows us to choose which position we want to configure a set for as well as what type of payload we would like to use.
	- When we use an attack type that only allows for a single payload set (i.e. Sniper or Battering Ram), the dropdown menu for "Payload Set" will only have one option, regardless of how many positions we have defined.
	- If we are using one of the attack types that use multiple payload sets (i.e. Pitchfork or Cluster Bomb), then there will be one item in the dropdown for each position.
	Note: Multiple positions should be read from top to bottom, then left to right when being assigned numbers in the "Payload Set" dropdown.

The second dropdown in this section allows us to select a "payload type". By default, this is a "Simple List" -- which, as the name suggests, lets us load in a wordlist to use. There are many other payload types available -- some common ones include: 'Recursive Grep', 'Numbers', and 'Username generator'.
- Payload Options differ depending on the payload type we select for the current payload set. For example, a "Simple List" payload type will give us a box to add and remove payloads to and from the set. Be warned: loading extremely large lists in here can cause Burp to crash! By contrast, the options for a 'Numbers' payload type allows us to change options such as the range of numbers used and the base that we are working with.
- Payload Processing allows us to define rules to be applied to each payload in the set before being sent to the target. For example, we could capitalise every word or skip the payload if it matches a regex.
- Finally, we have the Payload Encoding section. This section allows us to override the default URL encoding options that are applied automatically to allow for the safe transmission of our payload. Sometimes it can be beneficial to not URL encode these standard "unsafe" characters, which is where this section comes in. We can either adjust the list of characters to be encoded or outright uncheck the "URL-encode these characters" checkbox.

When combined, these sections allow us to perfectly tailor our payload sets for any attack we wish to carry out.
