Along with the old, attackers are continuously developing new threats to exploit vulnerable systems, smartphones, mobile applications, IoT devices, network equipment, and basically anything that is connected to the internet.

The number of events logged from these multiple data sources can be overwhelming and can possibly lead to poor recognition of a real attack in process or one that is actively damaging systems. In order to have an efficient process to support the management of incidents and events produced by multiple data systems, many organizations have implemented a solution known as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).

**What is a SIEM solution?**

A SIEM solution supports threat detection, compliance and security incident management through the collection and analysis (both near real-time and historical) of security events, as well as a wide variety of other event and contextual data sources.

The core capabilities are a broad scope of log event collection and management, the ability to analyze log events and other data across disparate sources, and operational capabilities (such as incident management, dashboards, and reporting).

Based on the definition, a SIEM enables IT staff to identify attacks before or as they occur, resulting in faster response times for incident response.

A SIEM solution works by collecting data from various sources such as computers, network devices, servers, and more. The data is then normalized and aggregated. Next, security professionals analyze the data to discover and detect threats. As a result, businesses are able to pinpoint security breaches and enable organizations to investigate alerts.

**Security incidents -** is an occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of an information system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.

**Security events -** is any observable occurrence in an information system including: operating systems; applications; devices; databases.

Depending on the number of events produced for each platform to be monitored, you can imagine the quantity of events logged can reach in the hundreds to thousands per hour rather quickly. Careful and precise tuning of the SIEM is required to detect and alert on events that pose the greatest risk.

It is this capability that sets the SIEM apart from other monitoring and detection tools on a network, such as an IPS or IDS. The SIEM doesnâ€™t actually replace the logging functionality of these devices. It simply works alongside these tools by ingesting and aggregating their log data to identify events that may lead to the potential exploit of a system.

**Understanding the SIEM process**

1.  collecting data from various sources
2.  normalizing and aggregate collected data
3.  analyzing the data to discover and detect threats
4.  pinpointing security breaches and enable organizations to investigate alerts.

**What are the benefits of SIEM security?**

Without a SIEM, IT staff will lack a centralized view of all logs and events. With limited visibility, IT staff will more than likely miss critical events from their systems, leading to a high number of backlogged events which may contain incidents that require immediate investigation.

On the other hand, having a SIEM increases efficiencies and enhances the incident response program.

In addition to a centralized dashboard common to most SIEM products today, a well-tuned SIEM can notify on a number of pre-defined categories and event thresholds.

More advanced SIEMs are now incorporating AI to alert on behavioral and pattern analysis.

**Why do SIEM projects fail?**

-   Lack of planning
-   lack of goals & objectives for SIEM solution
-   lack of training
-   lack of security resources to manage the SIEM tool
-   SIEM complexity
-   using SIEM solely for compliance
-   not speeding up the value with SIEM
