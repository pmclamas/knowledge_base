You don't need to code to contribute to Open Source! Documentation is one of the parts that is often overlooked. An easy way to make a contribution is to improve the documentation.

Copywriters should feel at home with those topics. Text assests and translations also present an easy entry.

Then, there's marketing, which is also often lacking in Open Source projects. Help a project with marketing, and this will also lure more potential contributors.

If every member of the community contributes a bit of time, a bit of effort, and a bit of personal experience, the whole community gains a terrific product, often free of charge.

Why is worth contributing to Open Source? Why should you spend your time writing some proposals or code or making translations instead of going for a walk?

There are several reasons. All of them stem from the premise that contributing to Open Source is publicly visible. Everybody can see what everyone else is doing. And that's great!

**You increase your competencies**

If you are writing a piece of code, designing an interface, or creating graphics, you are learning. This is a great for those looking for a career change.

In Open Source, nobody cares whether you work as a senior developer or as a gardener. What matters is the quality of the contribution you can bring. And once you prove yourself in an Open Source project, you will have gained some valuable experience. you will be an established member of a community with a track record that anubody can check.

**You improve your visibility**

When you join a community, such as an Open Source project, all your other channels, like your Linkedin our personal webpage, automatically become more visible.

It is common practice nowadays for IT recruiters to check out Github in search of new talent. By making your code public, you actually create a real-life resume anyone can verify.

And if your GitHub profile links to your Linkedin profile or your homepage, you are easily approachable so the chances of you landing a job of your dreams increase.

**How do you find your first project?**

There are several ways. First of all, the big players have a high user base and require a lot of changes and improvements. Once you introduce a change to such a project, your change becomes visible by millions. You can visit GitHub and see what are the most popular repositories.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend this first approach if you are a newcomer. Everybody wants to contribute, but there is a limited number of maintainers who are able to respond to your requests.

If you really want to make an impact, you can instead try smaller projects that are on the rise. 'GitHub Trending' is a place to find such cases.

Another approach is to select an _awesome_ project as a first time contributor. _Awesome_ projects are compiled and curated lists of links.

**What makes a contribution valuable?**

**We should respect the working conditions**

Above all, we should respect the working condtions of others. In many projects, you can find documents such as _'[Contributors.md](http://Contributors.md)'_ that present the preferred way of making contributions. If the project you wish to join doesn't have a similar document, check other possible places, like the '_[README.md](http://README.md)'_. Get acquainted with the rules and make sure you understand and obey them.

If your work doesn't meet the conditions outlined in the contributors' guidelines, it will probably be declined even before the review. Those guidelines and conditions serve to protect the time of maintainers. If you can't follow them, the maintainers may assume you are just as careless with the other work you do.

**Be Verbose in Communication**

Write down everything you know to explain the context in detail. This is particulary important when reporting errors. The more context you describe, the easier it will be for someone to fix it the way you want. Keep in mind the possible use cases and expected behavior, but leave out any details not necessarily related to the report.

**Run, Test, Check, Then Double-Check before submitting**

Check everything and test everything before you submit your change. Make sure your changes address the currently developed version, not some historical one. Keep in mind that you only need to run the tests once. The maintainers run many of them daily, so save them time by making sure everyting is top-notch. This just shows that you care and don't submit sloppy work.

**How to avoid getting discouraged online**

Remember this: each time you post something online, you open up yourself to criticism. You should welcome some of the criticism, as it will help you grow.

But there are also other kinds of criticism: toxic and unwarranted. It's best to learn how to deal with different kinds of criticism before you start sharing your work with the public. This way you will be prepared for what awaits you and won't take everything personal.

**Our best work may not be up to standards**

Even if you are doing something right, other people may push you to work even better. That's what reviewers are for. They should not be criticized or blamed, they want to help you!
