Pentesting can mean a lot of different things, from complicated and highly skilled adversarial simulation with a focus on the most important risks to a company right down to compliance - driven assurance to satisfy auditors or the tactical needs of a business. This creates a lot of inroads for people in terms of what to learn and where to enter.
Consume a bunch of content, network with communities to establish and build peers, and sample as many different flavours of pentesting as you can until you find something that really sticks.
###### The attributes of a talented and successful hacker are curiosity and perseverance.

The profile of a traditional pentester has evolved to that of a "Security Engineer" and demands better understanding of technology, development environments and deployment processes. New technologies, spanning from IoT devices connected to the internet to multi-cloud environments with managed container orchestration solutions, made the reconnaissance, exploitation and pivoting stages of penetration testing considerably more complex and heterogeneous, forcing security professionals to think different about how they approach security testing more holistically.
Pentesters must be able to find vulnerabilities on these newer attack surfaces, which require additional tools and processes to accomplish.
Greater emphasis on proficiency in vulnerability management skills used to plan, scope and manage weaknesses.
Vulnerability management skills have become more important because pentesters continue to find more vulnerabilities.
Many of those vulnerabilities cannot be mitigated, usually due to patching or software incompatibilities.

**Skills most critical to surviving current cyber threat environment?**
The ability to leverage automation tools to conduct efficient and effective vulnerability assessments.
We cannot detect all vulnerabilities, we cannot fix all high-risk security flaws at once, and we cannot stop all hackers.
Risk-based and threat-aware testing and remediation of vulnerabilities is essentially important for cybersecurity. In addition, the approach to program management and vulnerability management to sustain risk assessments across an evolving application portfolio needs to scale.
This means carefully choosing the right depth in testing and scanning, but also includes the ability to convey actionable findings, just in time to developers within their ecosystem to enable faster fix cycles.
