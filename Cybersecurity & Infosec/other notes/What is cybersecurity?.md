Being a CyberSecurity Engineer means being responsible for an entire network. This network includes computers, routers, mobile phones, and everything that connects to the internet.

We cannot rely on antivirus software, given how sophisticated today's hackers are. Besides, most attacks nowadays use social engineering as their entry point. This makes it even harder for cybersecurity professionals to detect and mitigate these attacks.

Being a Penetration Tester or White Hat, you will be "playing" with the same tools Black Hat hackers play with. Your goal is to help companies discover security vulnerabilities so they can fix them.

_**Top tools for beginner cybersecurity engineers**_

**-Wireshark-**

Having a solid foundation in networking is essential to becoming a good penetration tester. Wireshark is the world's best network analyzer tool. It is an open-source software that enables you to inspect real-time data on a live network.

Wireshark can dissect packets of data into frames and segments giving you detailed information about the bits and bytes in a packet. Wireshark can also be used as a packet sniffing tool if you are in a public network. Wireshark will have access to the entire network connected to a router.

Being able to capture data packets in realtime is an important utility for a penetration tester.

**-Nmap-**

Nmap is the first tool you will come across when you begin your career as a penetration tester. It is a fantastic network scanning tool that can give you detailed information about a target. This includes open ports, services, and the operating system running on the victim's computer.

Nmap is popular among penetration testers for many reasons. It is simple, flexible, and extensible. It offers a simple command-line interface where you can add a few flags to choose different types of scans.

Nmap also offers simple ping scans all the way up to aggressive scans that provide detailed ports and service information.

Nmap also provides a GUI tool called Zenmap with added utilities. You can build visual network maps and choose scans. Zenmap is a great place to start playing with Nmap commands if you are a beginner.

**-Ncat-**

Ncat (previously NetCat) is often referred to as the Swiss-army knife in networking.

Netcat is a simple but powerful tool that can view and record data on a TCP or UDP network connections. Netcat functions as a backend listener that allows for port scanning and port listening.

You can also tranfer files through Netcat or use it as a backdoor to your victim machine. This makes it a popular post-exploitation tool to establish connections after successful attacks. Netcat is also extensible given its capability to add scripting for larger or redundant tasks.

The Nmap team built an updated version of Netcat called Ncat with features including support for SSL, IPv6, SOCKS, and HTTP proxies.

**-Metasploit-**

Metasploit is not just a tool, but a complete framework that you can use during an entire penetration testing lifecycle.

Metasploit contains exploits for most of the vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure database. Using Metasploit, you can send payloads to a target system and gain access to it through a command line interface.

Metasploit is very advanced with the ability to do tasks such as port scanning, enumeration, and scripting in addition to exploitation.

**-Nikto-**

Nikto is an open-source tool that is capable of performing extensive web server scans. Nikto can help you scan for harmful files, misconfigurations, outdated software installations, and so on.

It also checks for the presence of multiple index files, HTTP, server configurations, and the installed web server software.

Nikto is the preferred tool for general web server security audits. Nikto is fast, but not quiet. You can scan a large web server pretty quickly but intrusion detection systems will easily pick up these scans. However, there is support for anti-IDS plugins in case you want to perform stealthy scans.

**-Burp Suite-**

Burp Suite aims to be an all in one set of tools for a variety of web application pen-testing use cases. It is also a popular tool among professional web app security researchers and bug bounty hunters.

Burp Suite's tools work together to support the entire web application testing lifecycle. From scanning to exploitation, Burpsuite offers all the tools you need for breaking into web applications.

One of Burp Suite's main feature is its ability to intercept HTTP requests. HTTP requests usually go from your browser to a web server and then the web server sends a response back. With Burp Suite, you can perform Man-in-the-middle operations to manipulate the request and response.

Burp Suite has tools for automation to make you work faster and more efficient.

In addition to its default features, Burp Suite is extensible by adding plugins called BApps.

**-John the Ripper-**

Passwords are still the de-facto standard of authentication in most systems. Even if you successfully get into a server or a database you will have to decrypt the password to gain privilege escalation.

John the Ripper is a simple tool used for cracking passwords. It is a super-fast password cracker with support for custom wordlists. It can run against most types of encryption methods like MD5 and SHA.

**-Aircrack-ng-**

Aircrack-ng is a set of tools that helps you to work with wireless networks. Aircrack comprises of tools that can capture wireless networks, crack WPA keys, inject packets, and so on.

Aircrack contains excellent algorithms for cracking WiFi passwords and to capture wireless traffic. It can also decrypt encrypted packets, making it a complete suite of tools for wireless penetration testing.

In short, you can use Aircrack for monitoring, attacking, and debugging all types of wireless networks.

**-Nessus-**

Nessus is a popular enterprise vulnerability scanner. Nessus is built to be a complete vulnerability analysis and reporting tool. While you can scan and find ports or services using Nmap, Nessus will tell you the list of vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.

Nessus has an excellent user interface, tens of thousands of plugins, and supports embedded scripting. It is often favored by enterprises since it helps companies audit for various compliances like PCI and HIPPA. Nessus will also tell you the severity of the vulnerabilities so that you can focus on those threats accordingly.

Nessus is not a free software, but offers a limited free home edition. Nessus has an open-source alternative called Open-Vas that offers similar features.

**-Snort-**

Snort is an pen-source software for detecting and preventing intrusions in a network. It can perform live traffic analysis and log incoming packets to detect port scans, worms, and other suspicious behavior.

Snort is used for defense compared to most of the other tools in this list. However, Snort helps to understand the attacker's methods by logging their activity. You can also build DNS sinkholes to redirect attacker traffic while finding attack vectors through Snort.

Snort also has a web-based GUI called BASE (Basic Analysis and Security Engine). BASE provides a web frontend to query and analyze the alerts coming from Snort.

**Conclusion**

In today's networked world, everyone from government agencies to banks stores critical information in the cloud. Cyber-attacks even have the potential to cripple an entire nation. Hence, protecting these networks is not a choice, but an absolute necessity.
